00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:04.415
Okay.

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:04.906
Yes, yes, of course, yeah, I'll be recording as well. Alright, uh…

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.760
So, let me just… Sorry, let me just share my screen. So I'll just share mostly off my screen because…

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:19.754
Um… just because I'll be opening up the project files.

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:26.495
Okay, and, sorry, let me just open up the… let me just open up the Zoom chat window.

00:00:45.103 --> 00:00:47.103
Sorry, one second… So, I've just got everything on three screens, so let me just, um, figure out where the…

00:00:50.414 --> 00:00:52.414
Okay, there we go.

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:54.718
Okay, um, so is my, um, is my screen being shared?

00:00:54.641 --> 00:01:01.641
Okay. Alright, perfect. Um, yeah, so firstly, I just want to say thanks for sending through the… sending through the projects.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.539
Yes, we can see yours.

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.959
Um, I had a look through all of them, all of them are really, really impressive.

00:01:05.473 --> 00:01:15.473
So, yeah, that's firstly what I wanted to say is, um, because I know that there was a limited time for everyone to sort of make these projects and, um, given the time, I want to say, like, I am definitely very impressed with.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:22.519
What the teams have been able to come up with, so, um, you know, props to the teams and props to… the teachers, the trainers.

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:40.529
Um, amazing job. And what I want to do is, I just want to go through basically every single, uh, every project, and… just, um, just add some comments. Now, in terms of the comments, mainly what I'll be focusing on, I'll focus on the positives, and I'll also focus on some areas where, um, I think can be improved.

00:01:41.586 --> 00:01:47.586
Right, just to give sort of, like, some constructive feedback on certain things that can, uh, that can potentially be adjusted in future.

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:54.096
So, that at least is my intent.

00:01:53.637 --> 00:02:00.637
Yeah, okay, sorry, but I think they already have more progress, uh, when they send to you, so maybe if… something new, they can show… show that to you.

00:02:05.513 --> 00:02:07.513
All right, okay. Sure, sure, okay. Well, in that case, I guess what… I guess what we can do is maybe I'll just share… I'll just show what I have on my end.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.399
And then if there's something that maybe has been addressed, then the students can share their screens, and we can go through that.

00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:13.605
Yeah.

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:24.815
Alright. So, let's start with the Team 1, Porcupine. Okay. So, um, first thing I want to say is, um, I do like the design, it's really cute.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:36.283
And, um, for, again, like, for a low-poly character, I think this, um, I think the… overall…

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:46.866
The overall topology is, um… the overall topology is fairly good. Now, there are going to… there are going to be some things which I've noticed among several projects which are, again, certain things that can be improved.

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:52.503
Right, so if I… if I mention them on one, I'll maybe mention them on the others, but I'm not going to go into detail, sort of.

00:02:58.786 --> 00:03:00.786
Uh, going through them. So, with this one, the animation that I saw…

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:07.038
Was… I believe there's a… walking animation, and… yep, so we've got the timeline down here.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.609
Okay? So I've got a looping animation. Which is great.

00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:22.954
And it does loop, um, it does loop back to the beginning, which is re- which is really good. We've got that sort of subtle head movement, which I really like.

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:27.801
One thing I'd want to… So, with this animation.

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.158
Is with the back legs, so if we look at it from the back.

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:42.778
So, they are clipping through the ground. That is basically, with this animation, that is probably the one thing that I would fix, because if we, for example, add a… plain to this, like, let's say we have a ground.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.580
In this case, the… Legs would be clipping… through the ground, right? Sort of like so. But that is basically a fairly minor thing that can be, um…

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.540
There can be reasonably… reasonably easily adjusted. Other than that, um, other than that, this is really good.

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:18.576
So, another thing that I'd want to mention, and this is something that I… Um, that I've noticed across several projects. And again, this is something that is really, really common for people who are, um, who are learning 3D, is NGONs, right? So there are quite a few.

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:21.826
So there are quite a few NGONs on a lot of these models.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:27.239
Right? And again, just as a reminder, en-ons are faces with more than four, um, more than four sides.

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:34.485
Right? And so, for example, we have an NGON. Oh, actually, no, sorry, that one isn't an angon. This…

00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:40.394
This one over here is an Engon, because it looks like there's four sides, but there's actually 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.990
If we turn on vertices mode, we can see that a little bit easier.

00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:53.934
And, uh, for characters, especially, especially for characters which need to be animated, I'd say that this is a very important thing to sort of address to avoid enginons, because they don't deform properly.

00:04:54.104 --> 00:05:00.104
Right? In this case, I understand that the head doesn't move… well, like, this part of the head wouldn't deform all that much.

00:05:07.836 --> 00:05:12.836
But it's generally good practice to avoid angons if possible. And also add more edge loops to where the character does deform, right? So instead of having, like, let's say a lot of edge loops over here, I would…

00:05:21.037 --> 00:05:23.037
Have a little bit more edge loops over here. And just a tip to, um… because if you have a… if you have a complex character, it might be far… it might be a bit difficult to find the angons.

00:05:27.273 --> 00:05:30.273
Just a tip for actually looking for them. If you go up here to Select, then go Select All by Trait.

00:05:36.277 --> 00:05:38.277
And grow faces by sides? Right? Um, what you can do is, you can basically select.

00:05:38.267 --> 00:05:46.267
All faces which have more than 4 vertices, right? And again, you can adjust this, so if you're looking for something specific.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:58.779
Right? But if you're looking for triangles, you can do the opposite. So, you know, if you go less than… less than 4 sides, then these are all the triangles on the character, and there's, um, obviously the caps on the eyes.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.020
Right? But in this case, if we go greater than, this just highlights all of the angons in the scene, and it's just.

00:06:05.504 --> 00:06:08.504
Good practice to sort of fix those, uh, fix those up a little.

00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:14.094
Right? Um… Let me just see what else… what else… what else I had.

00:06:13.805 --> 00:06:19.805
Yep. One other thing, and again, I don't know, again, a lot of… some of these things, you mentioned may have been addressed.

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:29.584
In the textures, one thing I noticed is there was this little, um… area over here, which is, um…

00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:35.611
Which sort of appears on the… On the character… sorry, let me just…

00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:39.496
Hide this. So just this, because I'm assuming that… I'm assuming that that was probably not, um, not exactly intentional.

00:06:41.254 --> 00:06:44.254
But aside from that, I'd say… I'd say a very good job with this one.

00:06:44.846 --> 00:06:47.846
Again, I'm… I don't mean to be… I don't mean to be particularly critical.

00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:56.456
Um, I do… I do genuinely like all of the projects, but I think that just for today, the, um… I think the most value would be for me to give, sort of, feedback on areas where.

00:06:56.127 --> 00:07:04.127
You could improve. Alright, um, so with this one, is there anything, sort of, the team, uh, would additionally like to mention or share?

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.335
Yep. And what if there is anything you want to… General. Um, yeah, thank you for the feedback. This topology.

00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:22.753
Not all good.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:24.943
But, um… The problem we're facing in this one week, and we still can't.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:32.156
Solve it. It's equaled. That's why there is no query in there.

00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:33.501
Mm-hmm.

00:07:36.485 --> 00:07:38.485
And, yeah, yeah.

00:07:42.152 --> 00:07:44.152
Quill. The quill.

00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:48.945
Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. There's no what, sorry? Oh, there's no, there's no quills, yeah. Um, yeah, with the… so, with the… with the quills, uh, what I… what I would potentially do…

00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:54.584
If you want to add quills, is… I would probably just create them as curves, and then convert to meshes.

00:07:55.522 --> 00:08:01.522
And then if you, uh… the other thing you would just have to do is just be careful with the weights, alright? So, um, I'll just make one.

00:08:02.202 --> 00:08:04.202
Just to sort of show what I mean, so if we take a curve.

00:08:09.304 --> 00:08:12.304
Right? So, um, I usually use paths. For this… I'll just turn on… turn off…

00:08:17.012 --> 00:08:19.012
Turn that off… Individual origins are turned on. Sorry, um…

00:08:19.664 --> 00:08:25.664
Okay. So I've got a path, and let's just add a Bezier curve to… Define the profile.

00:08:29.731 --> 00:08:31.731
Right? So, I'm just gonna move this… Why is that moving like that? That's… that's a little bit odd. Alright.

00:08:36.246 --> 00:08:38.246
Okay.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.830
Sorry, the busy occurs doing something weird. Give me a second.

00:08:45.164 --> 00:08:49.164
Oh, right, sorry, um, snap-to-face is turned on, that's probably it, okay.

00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:56.501
So I'm working in your project, so I might miss some things. Alright, so that just creates the profile of the curve.

00:08:59.295 --> 00:09:03.295
And then… if we go Curve, Geometry. We can add some depth.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.877
And then, with the taper object, we just choose the Bezier curve.

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.651
Right? So this gives us this, um, shape. Now, the next thing is just changing the resolution down here.

00:09:18.649 --> 00:09:22.649
And up here. Right, so the resolution down here, this just… If we look at it from the side…

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:27.419
This just adds more, um… more edges, sort of, in a circumference.

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:34.065
Right? For this, you can use something really, really small. Again, it's a low-poly character. One is, I think, more than enough for this.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.300
And then resolution preview up here, you just lower that until it's, um… Until it's what you need. So…

00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:49.148
Let's just… let's just place this. So, I don't remember where Porcupine, um… spine score, but let's say, I think it's somewhere in the butt, so let's just go there.

00:09:49.592 --> 00:09:56.592
Also, for something that's just a simple curve, what you can do is you can just dissolve two of the vertices. So if you press X and then dissolve.

00:10:02.758 --> 00:10:06.758
Right? Um, okay, we do need more resolution, though. Right? And do something like that, honestly, I think that that, for this type of character, again, it's very low poly.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:17.950
You probably don't… like, I wouldn't want anything too high, like, I wouldn't go, you know, anything crazy, like… you know, 10, because there's…

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:26.849
If you have this be at a really high resolution, it just looks very… it just looks too different from the base, um, from the base mesh, so there's probably no point.

00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:36.119
Um, so make sure that, like, generally you want your… average level of, you know, size of your faces to be around… to be roughly the same.

00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:44.785
So if we go… let's say, like, 3… Okay? Then what you can do is… You can also duplicate.

00:10:45.497 --> 00:10:49.497
The spines as well, so I'm just pressing Shift-D to sort of just duplicate them.

00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:55.055
Right? And sort of just place them around. And then, once you're done, right-click.

00:10:58.238 --> 00:11:00.238
Convert to mesh. Okay, now… so now that's just a 3D model.

00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:04.545
And then what you'd want to do is, uh, where is our armature?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:21.380
Actually, not the armature. So, there's a way in Blender to actually sort of copy weight data from a… from one mesh to the other, I'll be completely honest, I don't remember exactly what the process is, so you can have a look at that, there's definitely tutorials online.

00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:26.521
But, uh, for now, if we just go to weights. Let's just have a look at the weights here.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:32.647
So it should be one of those, um… Okay, so that's root, hip…

00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:38.478
Okay, so probably hip, right? I'm guessing hip for this. What we'll do is… oh, actually, sorry.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.770
I'm just gonna copy that, and I'm just gonna add a vertex screw called HIP.

00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:49.923
And then, in edit mode, I'm just gonna assign. All of these to the hip bone.

00:11:58.088 --> 00:12:00.088
And then if we join this up… Um, oh, I should have done this when this was in, um, when this was in the default pose, not, um, not the animation, but it's the… it should still work.

00:12:04.255 --> 00:12:08.255
So let's go to Dope Sheet, um, Action Editor. Walking…

00:12:09.298 --> 00:12:12.298
So, you see, like, it's, um… For this, it's pretty much good enough.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.430
Now, in terms of the weights, you'd have to be more careful if you're putting them in places which really deform.

00:12:17.164 --> 00:12:21.164
So, if we have a look at the weights, for example.

00:12:26.708 --> 00:12:28.708
You know, where there's transitions. Like, uh, let's say…

00:12:34.112 --> 00:12:36.112
So, if you were to put them somewhere over here. Right? You'd have to probably blend them somewhat between the neck bone, the head bone.

00:12:39.922 --> 00:12:42.922
Maybe the… what is it, the chest bone, or whichever one… Uh, you have, just to make sure that they don't, sort of, move.

00:12:42.744 --> 00:12:46.744
Differently from the rest of the rest of the mesh during animation.

00:12:47.244 --> 00:12:52.244
But generally, I would just probably do it like this, because this part, especially on the back, it's not going to move all that much.

00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:03.878
Right? It's not going to deform all that much, so, you know, even… Now, if we just press play, you see that… looks mostly fine. So, that is probably what I would do in terms of the spines, just to see, um, um…

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.789
Just to sort of do it fairly simply. I… I don't think that there's any reason to…

00:13:10.608 --> 00:13:17.608
Make these all sort of one mesh, necessarily. So, you know, just having them be their own separate thing.

00:13:20.923 --> 00:13:22.923
That's completely fine for this, sort of like you have the eye… as its own separate thing, as well.

00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:29.021
Right? So, I would just do that.

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:38.246
Um, okay, that's really helpful. Thank you, that's… Uh, and then, how could we animate…

00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:42.644
The quill that can be… Racing straight and down.

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:49.405
The quills, so if you want them to… if you want them to go up and down, for this, probably you'd use bones.

00:13:50.238 --> 00:13:55.238
Um, but in terms of the bones, you probably don't need anything complex.

00:13:55.638 --> 00:14:02.638
Right, so… hold on. Also, things might break right now because I'm using… I'm not using my own project, but if we just, let's say, duplicate this.

00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:16.751
And then… let's say… So if you have a bone somewhere over there, you can probably have just, like, one bone control quite a few quills, right? You don't need a separate bone for every quill, I don't think that's necessary for this project.

00:14:19.075 --> 00:14:22.075
Right? So, you know, just one bone per group. And then, with this bone.

00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:37.089
Sorry, let me just see what the hierarchy is here. Okay, so… Yeah, sure. Okay. So, what is this bone called? This is called stomach 01, let's just call it something else, let's just call it Quill…

00:14:40.786 --> 00:14:41.786
0? Okay, and then… what we'll do is…

00:14:41.286 --> 00:14:45.286
Yeah, we want it to be parented, actually, we want it to be parented to the hip bone.

00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:51.601
Which it is. That's good. And then, with this stuff.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.690
So, firstly, we want to… add a new vertex group, and just call it quill underscore 0, and assign it to that. But what you also need to do…

00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:06.085
If we go into weight paint mode, right now you see they're assigned to quill.

00:15:10.032 --> 00:15:12.032
And if we move this around… It will move, but you see it's gonna… it's doing some weird stuff?

00:15:16.032 --> 00:15:22.032
Right? Like, it's shrinking. The reason that it's doing that weird stuff is because they are still… parent… they are still, um, weighted to the hip bone.

00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:29.625
So we click on HIP, you see they're still weighted to that. So what you want to do is you just want to go into edit mode, and then remove them from the head bone.

00:15:36.005 --> 00:15:40.005
Okay? Now, um, if we go to Quill… There we go. And you can do some blending, maybe you can have the hip bone affect them at the bottom, but I don't think that's necessary.

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:45.575
For this. And then, if we go into pose mode… You see that sort of does that.

00:15:45.947 --> 00:15:48.947
Right? And then you just animate it the same way you would animate the rest.

00:15:51.664 --> 00:15:54.664
So, it probably, with this one. Probably wouldn't have, for example.

00:15:58.449 --> 00:16:03.449
Uh, this one be that low… that low down, so I just, you know, I'd put them roughly in the same area.

00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:11.331
Right? But then, if you. Just pose this, that can… If we just have a look over here…

00:16:16.867 --> 00:16:17.867
That will just let you… sort of pose that, right? And then, yeah, basically you just animate it the same way, so.

00:16:23.322 --> 00:16:26.322
If we, um, you know. If we just keyframe that there…

00:16:27.814 --> 00:16:29.814
Keyframe that there. Just copy that keyframe over to the end.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.824
And then, you know, let's just do that for some reason.

00:16:33.927 --> 00:16:38.927
Let's just move it over there. So I know that this is not how quills work, but just to demonstrate the animation.

00:16:42.145 --> 00:16:44.145
So, Anel… So that should lower, it should do some crazy movement.

00:16:49.715 --> 00:16:51.715
And then it should go back to the beginning. Um, that keyframe should probably be at, yeah, frame 200, or…

00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:54.786
Tour one, depending on where the rest are. Yeah, 200. So, yeah, hopefully that helps.

00:16:57.034 --> 00:16:59.034
And, uh, yeah. Other than that, like, really love the design, it's really cute.

00:16:59.965 --> 00:17:04.965
Yeah, I think this technique also applies for heads-up too, I think.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.570
For water? Uh, for hershock, yes, yeah, absolutely.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.210
That's fault.

00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:24.999
Yeah, so, um, yeah, for the Hedgehog, definitely this would apply. So anything where you have… Um, you just need to be careful with the weights, just to make sure that when everything's moving around, things aren't sliding away from each other, so that's just the one thing you need to consider.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.670
But other than that, yeah, basically just use bones for this.

00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:31.581
And again, if, uh, you know, if you have a bunch of quills.

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:34.176
By the way, I don't…

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.570
I don't think you'd need more than, at most, like, I don't know, 4, 5, 6 bones.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:44.309
For all the quills, because you can move them as a group. You definitely don't need to… move all these individually, there's just no point.

00:17:50.262 --> 00:17:52.262
Yeah. Mhm. Okay. Um…

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.750
Oh, okay, I think we're good. Yep.

00:17:54.325 --> 00:17:56.325
Yeah, really good job. Alright. Should we, um, should we move on to the next one?

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.330
Yeah, we could move the second group.

00:18:04.818 --> 00:18:06.818
Okay. Okay, perfect. So, with the next one, so, um, over here I've got number 2, Alpaca, and…

00:18:13.068 --> 00:18:16.068
I believe it's this blend file, the environment. Okay, um, also, also, just a tip, if anyone sort of gets this, they get this sort of blue.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:25.222
Blue stuff. This is… if you go up here into viewport overlays, it's face orientation. So it's just showing, like, where the normals are facing.

00:18:32.493 --> 00:18:34.493
Um, so with this one. Uh, just to be clear, because I didn't, um, at least with this project, there weren't any animations, so just to confirm, there are no animations for this one at the moment.

00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:42.855
Yeah, this is… we didn't put the animation in there, but they already have done their animation in their projects.

00:18:43.466 --> 00:18:48.466
Okay, cool, perfect. All right, well, in that case, I'll just give my feedback on, sort of, what we have here.

00:18:47.908 --> 00:18:53.908
So, firstly, firstly, really love the design, uh, really cool design of the Alpaca.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.550
Yeah. Yeah.

00:19:00.062 --> 00:19:02.062
Uh, love the environment as well. Um, you know, I can definitely see you can create some kind of, like, cool scene here where…

00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:04.723
We've maybe got the, uh, the alpaca walking past the police… the police department.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.270
And doing some… and doing some stuff. That's really cool. Now, let me just hide everything…

00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:21.708
Except for the alpaca. So, with this one. Uh, what… so, same thing as with the… same thing as with the porcupine. Uh, just look for en-ons.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.640
Right? So again, especially on a… on an animated model, or a model that you would animate.

00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:32.952
Just look out for Angon, so again, if you go select… Um, where is it?

00:19:33.523 --> 00:19:37.523
All by trade, faces by sides, and we go greater than 4.

00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:50.146
There are a few engines here, so those are just something that I would fix up. Overall, the topology is really good, so… fairly even, you don't have a lot of, you know, really small faces and a lot of really big faces.

00:19:50.186 --> 00:20:01.186
You've got more geometry where the… where the arm bends, and at the knee, which is really good to see. So, you're gonna get more even, like, better.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.580
Better deformation there, right? But just the… the end, you've got a few, sort of, around the… got a few around the shoes.

00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:19.089
Um, and, like, with the shoes, it's not… It is important, but it's not as important, because these probably won't actually.

00:20:18.872 --> 00:20:24.872
Change their shape all that much. But where it is important is, especially in areas where the character does bend.

00:20:24.801 --> 00:20:29.801
You know, I would fix up NGONs in this area, I would fix, uh, I would fix them up up here.

00:20:35.378 --> 00:20:39.378
Um, and potentially add a little bit more geometry around the… sort of around the shoulder area, so maybe just, like, a couple more edge loops.

00:20:42.247 --> 00:20:44.247
Sort of here, and… what I would do is, you have these really big faces here.

00:20:47.731 --> 00:20:50.731
What I would do instead is maybe just, um, have… have a couple more edges.

00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:53.551
Kind of going this way, if that kind of makes sense.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.870
Right? Something like that. And then, with this one, you can either… uh… you can either add, like.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.460
At an edge loophole, or just join it up. Somehow. Other than that, um, let's see if there's anything else I…

00:21:08.537 --> 00:21:13.537
As something else I had. Yeah, um, so you mentioned that the team is still working on this project.

00:21:17.305 --> 00:21:20.305
The UVs, but I didn't know if that was… something that's already been sort of fixed or not.

00:21:19.622 --> 00:21:31.622
Because right now, I notice that, um, there aren't textures on it at the moment, but, like, with the UVs, there are some issues, so just, um, wanted to find out if the team, if that's something the team is addressing.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.292
Or if they're just using materials in Blender, in which case it doesn't really matter.

00:21:43.501 --> 00:21:45.501
Great deal. Hello? Yeah. Okay, actually…

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.950
Right now, I'm not even that part of your prep. Because I'm using Montreal for color.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.010
Alright.

00:21:55.264 --> 00:21:58.264
And, uh, you… They said, okay, I feel my let's broken.

00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:58.383
Okay, yep.

00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:03.522
Uh, yeah, sure, let me stop sharing. Hold on, stop share.

00:22:10.003 --> 00:22:12.003
Yep.

00:22:21.628 --> 00:22:24.628
Let's progress. Uh, the previous one, I'm using Rejify, and I cannot…

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.180
Uh, at the bone, or the ear, and the… the deal, but I don't know, I give you my…

00:22:36.586 --> 00:22:40.586
Minority, or magi. And maybe this is… Oh my god, so what if I intention?

00:22:46.189 --> 00:22:48.189
Yeah, sure, yeah, let's see the animation.

00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:15.679
That's a really cool animation. Animation is really cute. One thing, um, can you, uh, can you, um, show the bones?

00:23:16.385 --> 00:23:24.385
I really love the animation. One thing I would change is you've got the hips kind of moving up in the middle, uh, really sharply. That's, like, the one thing that I would probably change in this.

00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:36.451
Yeah, so just a neutral pose.

00:23:40.238 --> 00:23:42.238
Did I show the others.

00:23:42.818 --> 00:23:44.818
Yeah, sure, sure.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.080
Yeah, well, love the animation. Um… yeah, really great use of, like, anticipation and some other principles, really good.

00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:10.598
First one, I want to add a group chain for my… But I don't know how to… Like, place, uh, yeah, gold tin… necklace.

00:24:13.227 --> 00:24:15.227
Oh, um, do you want… Do you want it to be animated?

00:24:15.533 --> 00:24:17.533
You want to put that in the crafter?

00:24:18.664 --> 00:24:24.664
I think it's just moving, like, are you.

00:24:19.398 --> 00:24:24.398
Because whether you answer yes or no to that question, it will add a lot of work.

00:24:28.184 --> 00:24:32.184
Oh.

00:24:41.736 --> 00:24:43.736
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I remember there was, like, there was, like, this meme where, um, if you talk to, like, character artists, like, creating a dragon that breathes fire and, like, you know, does a lot of crazy stuff, that's easy, but carrying… having a character take off a scarf is, like, near impossible.

00:24:51.999 --> 00:24:53.999
Um, so… Uh, with… okay, with a gold chain, if you want it to be animated, then…

00:24:58.691 --> 00:25:01.691
Yeah, that… you'll have some… you'll have some issues. Um, especially if it's, like, a game character, because, um…

00:25:00.598 --> 00:25:11.598
Well, what I mean by animated is whether you want it to be animated separately, like, for example, in this run animation, do you want it to sort of, like, you know, float up and then hit back onto the chest, right? Something like that. Like, that is, um, that is genuinely.

00:25:18.974 --> 00:25:21.974
Going to be a bit tricky. You might actually, um… I'm just even thinking what the best way to do that is, because if it's a game, you're not going to be using, sort of like, simulations or anything like that.

00:25:23.295 --> 00:25:36.295
Um, like, it's doable, you can probably do it, you can probably do it with morph targets, even, at some point, but at the moment, I, like, I personally probably advise against having, like, a separately animated chain.

00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:40.696
Right? Um, if you just want to create a chain by itself.

00:25:40.938 --> 00:25:46.938
Right? Yeah, actually, maybe that was the question. Is that the question, like, how to create a chain?

00:25:51.635 --> 00:25:53.635
Yeah. Your question is. With it or the animation.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.200
Oh, okay. In terms of cr… Okay, so…

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:03.799
Awesome. Yeah. Oh, her question is…

00:26:05.477 --> 00:26:11.477
Uh, is it better to create a new object chain, or is it modeling from the… Uh, character.

00:26:15.943 --> 00:26:18.943
Yeah, excellent from that.

00:26:17.198 --> 00:26:19.198
Oh, um… with that, I'd probably… no, I'd probably model it as a separate object.

00:26:23.557 --> 00:26:26.557
Um, so, wait, um, let me just share my screen.

00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:32.964
Bob share?

00:26:35.946 --> 00:26:37.946
Okay, give me a minute. Alright, so with a chain.

00:26:39.486 --> 00:26:46.486
Modeling it from your character, I mean, usually it's… if you want to model something from your existing mesh, it's best to go off, like, the geometry that you already have.

00:26:48.192 --> 00:26:57.192
So, you know, you could… you could, of course, take something like, you know, this face loop over here and, you know, just, like, insert that a bit, and then… Um, add some depth.

00:27:07.474 --> 00:27:10.474
And then, if we add a new material. And then just assign that, right? That can be a chain, but that doesn't really look like a chain, right? If you want to model a chain, um…

00:27:16.708 --> 00:27:19.708
Um, if you wanted to, like, let's say, model it. Chain specifically using your mesh, you'd have to make a lot of loop cuts, and you'd end up with really awkward geometry, so I would model it separately.

00:27:25.134 --> 00:27:30.134
Right? Um, in terms of modeling it separately, though, what you probably can do… is… sorry, let me…

00:27:30.624 --> 00:27:32.624
Uh, sorry, let me just. All of these, I'll just create a new one here.

00:27:37.503 --> 00:27:39.503
Oh. Wait, uh, let me… Sure, we'll just… we'll just create it from here.

00:27:38.927 --> 00:27:46.927
So, for a chain, again, this is a fairly low-poly character, so I wouldn't create a super complex chain, but if you make two links, right, two links of a chain.

00:27:47.326 --> 00:27:52.326
What you can do is you can then array them along a curve, right? That would probably be my best suggestion for doing it.

00:27:58.362 --> 00:28:02.362
Right? What I mean by that is, let's just create a plane… Just inset it…

00:28:05.795 --> 00:28:10.795
Okay, um, I think the measurements are a little bit wrong here, but, um… Let's go over SX and SY… Okay, so let's say this is a link 1.

00:28:18.573 --> 00:28:20.573
And this is link 2. Right? So, let's just also…

00:28:26.494 --> 00:28:28.494
Make this a lot smaller. And then, uh, what we need to do is we need to…

00:28:28.632 --> 00:28:32.632
So, it's just… this is not something… I don't usually array along… I don't usually, like.

00:28:36.108 --> 00:28:41.108
Make my end stuff in Blender, uh, because I usually work with, like, Unreal Engine or something else, but… I think you can array along a circle.

00:28:45.944 --> 00:28:47.944
Unless I'm very mistaken. Wait, let me just go… so if we go array…

00:28:54.026 --> 00:28:56.026
I believe it's Generate Array? Right? So this is the first one that you'd want to do, and you just want to change it a little bit so that…

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.990
It's, like, maybe .8 or something, or… Is that correct? Yeah, maybe, like, 0.9?

00:29:01.658 --> 00:29:07.658
Sure. And then, what you need to do is, uh, where is it? Deform Curve.

00:29:08.357 --> 00:29:11.357
I believe. So there's a specific order that you need to do this in, sir.

00:29:18.488 --> 00:29:20.488
Yeah, there we go. Okay, so I was correct. And then, we just take this curve…

00:29:23.187 --> 00:29:25.187
And…

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:29.990
Also, the reason I'm not using hotkeys is because I work with, like.

00:29:29.683 --> 00:29:37.683
Um, I work with Maya, I work with, um, I work with Cinema for D, I work with Blender, and so I've given up remembering the hotkeys.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:47.900
There are some that I use constantly, but a lot of them I just, um, I just don't… I also recently got a new mouse, so… tweaking those settings is a little bit awkward.

00:29:52.339 --> 00:29:55.339
Okay, let's just place that there, and then… Take that, place it there, and then there are some…

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.060
Here, which we just adjust. And then…

00:30:05.109 --> 00:30:08.109
And then we just need to sort of adjust the… um, adjust the count, that's one thing.

00:30:08.299 --> 00:30:14.299
So it's like 2. And then you can also… you can still edit the original mesh, right? So if we press Tab.

00:30:14.518 --> 00:30:17.518
You can do that, and then maybe just make that a little bit smaller?

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.950
Or a little bit bigger. Until it sort of fits, and yeah. So, you know, it's… it still needs some…

00:30:29.113 --> 00:30:34.113
Adjustment, right? But this is probably what I would… This is probably what I would do in terms of a chain.

00:30:36.817 --> 00:30:39.817
Right? Um, for a character like this. You know, I just need to place it a bit more carefully.

00:30:48.118 --> 00:30:55.118
Let's go… that. And then you still have to do all the weights, obviously, so… that's another thing, you just need to, um… Uh, try to adjust the weights to… to the rig, because right now, obviously, it's not gonna, um, it's not gonna deform.

00:30:54.811 --> 00:30:59.811
But, yeah, this is basically how I would do it. That would be my suggestion.

00:31:06.288 --> 00:31:08.288
Okay, so… If the parent reading for the test for the main party?

00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:11.981
Sorry, it's a little bit quiet, I didn't quite catch that.

00:31:13.781 --> 00:31:16.781
They would… yeah, they would need to, peron the… negates to the bone.

00:31:25.752 --> 00:31:27.752
Yes, yeah, because right now. If we have… oh, well, um, hold on. We don't have any animations, but…

00:31:37.159 --> 00:31:39.159
Okay, and then let's just move that down. Right? So… Yeah. You know, no, um, nothing, nothing happening there. So yeah, you would need to parent it.

00:31:51.065 --> 00:31:53.065
So, you would need to actually… Um… If this is the Rigify tool, just, like, you know, try to do it through Rigify, and then you would have to adjust the weights. Now, this is a very tricky sort of spot to do it in as well.

00:31:52.634 --> 00:32:02.634
Right? Um, because you've got the weights, you've got a lot of different weights, kind of, um, fighting with each other. You've got the spine bones, you've got the neck bones, you've also got the shoulder bones and the arm bones.

00:32:07.957 --> 00:32:09.957
So this will be a little bit tricky to do. Um, the smaller this is, the… let me just convert this to a mesh for a second.

00:32:10.494 --> 00:32:16.494
Um, the smaller this is, the easier it will be. If you just do it sort of around the neck, or maybe around the shoulder areas, kind of like this.

00:32:16.409 --> 00:32:21.409
That will… that will be a little bit easier, right? But, um, yeah.

00:32:22.486 --> 00:32:24.486
Basically, that's the, um, that's the way you could do it.

00:32:25.396 --> 00:32:29.396
Actually, sorry. One other way that you could do it, which might make things a little bit simpler.

00:32:35.248 --> 00:32:37.248
So, let's go… Oh, wait, sorry, no, not that. Extrude?

00:32:44.678 --> 00:32:47.678
Alright, so the idea being… you basically make a…

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:59.006
A circle sort of like this, right? And again, just adjust it so that it's, um… Um, so that it's the same shape, right, as the necklace. I'm not gonna go through the whole process now.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:03.350
And then you basically make a chain texture with an opacity mask.

00:33:03.107 --> 00:33:12.107
Right? So, that would be another way to do it, which, um, it will not look as good as the regular chain, but it might not matter.

00:33:06.873 --> 00:33:08.873
Oh, yeah.

00:33:12.083 --> 00:33:15.083
And also, it's going to be a lot easier with the UVs.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.770
Right? That, um… So, yeah, that would basically be, um, my suggestion. Either one… either that version or this.

00:33:28.637 --> 00:33:30.637
Thank you so much.

00:33:30.481 --> 00:33:32.481
No, no, I'll get… all good. Alright, um, okay, we'll move on to the… we'll move on to the next one.

00:33:39.527 --> 00:33:42.527
Now, next project that I've got here is the turtle. Turtle, um… okay, so for…

00:33:46.908 --> 00:33:52.908
Firstly… firstly, for this one, um, for this one, the textures for me, um, weren't in the… went in the project, but I did… But I did see the demo video. I want to say, great job on the demo video.

00:33:58.846 --> 00:34:01.846
Uh, textures, uh, textures look really cool. So…

00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:04.561
Love the walking animation, you've got the jumping animation somewhere in here.

00:34:09.144 --> 00:34:11.144
It's very cute. So yeah, really love this.

00:34:13.748 --> 00:34:17.748
So, um, looking at the actual model itself. Right? Looking at the model itself.

00:34:27.557 --> 00:34:29.557
Really like the design. Really cool. Sorry, let me just see the, um… let me just see the things that I wanted to sort of mention here.

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:34.989
Right? Okay, so… wait, sorry, what did I… what did I want to mention?

00:34:49.495 --> 00:34:51.495
Uh, yeah. The… So overall, um, overall, it looks really good. One thing that I'd, uh, that I would mention is with the body specifically, so I know that this was, um, so you did sub-D modeling, so you had a, you had a more basic shape, and then you subdivided it.

00:34:54.928 --> 00:35:00.928
To get this shape, right? Which, um, which that's completely fine. What it does… Um, what I would do is I would do a little bit more cleanup.

00:35:06.428 --> 00:35:10.428
Right? Because you've got a lot of, um, you've got a lot of extra edge loops which you don't need, so… If, for example, especially we look in these areas, like, all of these edge loops over here, like this.

00:35:10.752 --> 00:35:15.752
All of these, if they are removed, that will not change anything about the model at all.

00:35:15.628 --> 00:35:20.628
Right, so I would generally, um, I would generally remove a lot of these unnecessary.

00:35:21.166 --> 00:35:26.166
Edges, especially over here, you've got these bevels, but they're so small that it's not really playing a difference.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.840
Right, so I would just remove… all of these from the character. They're… again, that's not really gonna change anything.

00:35:33.967 --> 00:35:38.967
And then, you know, Mark Sharp… well, you'll have to do it on your end, because for me.

00:35:42.027 --> 00:35:44.027
Um, I'd need a split. The data to sort of fix that.

00:35:44.441 --> 00:35:50.441
And then, um, that's also the reason why, like, here at the bottom, you have a lot of these sort of vertices.

00:35:55.751 --> 00:35:57.751
Down here, if we just sort of select this area. Okay, let's say that's that rough area.

00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:06.703
Over there, what are my… what are my statistics? Statistics. So, over there, you've got, um…

00:36:05.781 --> 00:36:11.781
You've got… you've got, like, 3,000 faces there, that's definitely way, way more than you need.

00:36:18.527 --> 00:36:20.527
Because this is an area that will never deform. So, this is, um, uh, again, the overall shape. The overall shape is really good, but…

00:36:22.383 --> 00:36:29.383
Um, if you're never gonna see this area, and especially if it's not really deforming, you definitely don't need this much geometry. So that would just be… my, sort of, main tip.

00:36:38.293 --> 00:36:40.293
About, uh, about this 3D model. Now, another thing… So, I notice over here, you've got a lot of…

00:36:38.845 --> 00:36:41.845
You've got a lot of these extra, sort of, edge loops.

00:36:45.035 --> 00:36:47.035
Right? And. I'm assuming that what was happening.

00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:55.785
Was, um… So if we take a plane, and then…

00:36:57.993 --> 00:36:59.993
We'll sort of extrude that. Right? So let's say that I want to subdivide this.

00:37:04.969 --> 00:37:08.969
Alright, and I want to subdivide it by quite a bit, but I want this edge… Over here, like these edges, I want them to sort of stay.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.370
Right? So… generally, what I'm assuming that you did here, and what a lot of people do, is…

00:37:16.154 --> 00:37:19.154
You add an edge loop, like this, and then you just sort of bring it down.

00:37:19.404 --> 00:37:23.404
Right? And that kind of, um… and that basically creates that sharp edge.

00:37:30.509 --> 00:37:34.509
The problem with that is that if you do that. Right? And then I apply this, you end up with a lot of these extra edge loops that you generally don't need.

00:37:38.872 --> 00:37:41.872
So, what I would suggest instead of that… is, if you haven't used it, the Edge Crease Tool.

00:37:42.767 --> 00:37:46.767
Right? This is something that's super useful, and it's specifically for situations like this.

00:37:52.087 --> 00:37:54.087
So, over here, um, in the. Um, so if you just press N, and then it's the first… the first panel, the transform panel.

00:37:59.253 --> 00:38:01.253
You've got mean crease, right? Now, if you select these edges, and you go Mean Crease and set that to 1.

00:38:02.024 --> 00:38:07.024
Right? That basically does exactly what you want, that sort of, um, that sharpening.

00:38:07.108 --> 00:38:12.108
Uh, without extra… adding extra edge loops. And then, if we apply the subdivision.

00:38:12.065 --> 00:38:17.065
You'll notice that the faces are a lot more even, so you've got a lot more even geometry.

00:38:17.021 --> 00:38:23.021
So, generally for situations like this, if you want to sort of model it in sort of that subdivision.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.710
Um, workflow. Use a lot of, um, use edge crease, or, like, mean crease, for wherever you want those sharp edges.

00:38:35.698 --> 00:38:37.698
As opposed to adding a lot more edge loops. Right, so that would just be, um, that would be my suggestion.

00:38:43.737 --> 00:38:45.737
Aside from that, let me just see if… Yeah, aside from that, I don't think I had any, um, any other notes.

00:38:51.484 --> 00:38:54.484
The… yeah, I don't think there were any issues. That I saw necessarily with the UVs. There's something there, but… wait, is that something that I did?

00:39:00.012 --> 00:39:02.012
Sorry. What is that? That is the…

00:39:01.475 --> 00:39:05.475
Oh, yeah, that's… that's because I cut that off, so that's… that's my bad, that's my fault.

00:39:13.033 --> 00:39:15.033
And… Yeah, you've got a separate material for the eye. This is technically fine, but…

00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:23.231
For a low-poly character, it might not even be necessary. Right, so with… there's always a balance of how many materials slots you actually need.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:32.160
Versus, you know, the actual resolution of your textures. If you can fit everything onto one… into one material, um, that's… that's very often completely fine.

00:39:31.999 --> 00:39:36.999
Something I noticed here, which is… which is… which is good to see, is that you've got the front.

00:39:37.279 --> 00:39:41.279
Part of the eye, um, take up a lot more space on the UV map than the back.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:51.460
Uh, which is, uh, which, yep, that's, uh, that's a good idea, because… That is just using up… that is just using up texture space that…

00:39:51.652 --> 00:39:54.652
Is never going to be seen, so that's really good. Yeah. Other than that, great job.

00:40:01.651 --> 00:40:07.651
Thank you, and I want to ask about, uh, isn't I need to, like, uh, re… if I want to rework the mesh and the vertex, I will reduce.

00:40:08.555 --> 00:40:14.555
The model here, I rework again with the way painting, or I just delay it and it's fine?

00:40:23.534 --> 00:40:27.534
Um, look, look, look, for this, um, I'd say if you want to… So, um… The mesh itself overall, overall, the mesh is completely fine, it's just, um…

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:33.224
Uh, it's just a little bit too subdivided, right? That's the only thing. So I don't think it's necessary to completely rework it.

00:40:40.454 --> 00:40:46.454
Right? Now, if, for example, you were actually doing this for a production game, then yes, you might need to… Um, uh, you might need to do a… do a little bit more. However, if you've got, like, let's say an older version of this mesh.

00:40:46.818 --> 00:40:49.818
Right? If you've got an older version before it was subdivided.

00:40:50.505 --> 00:40:58.505
Um, maybe go… maybe have a look at that one, and just delete those extra, sort of, edge loops that you've got, you know, in areas like here.

00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:05.502
And, um… you know, on the shell, like, the different edge loops that you've got over here, and try to use Mean Crease instead.

00:41:05.237 --> 00:41:11.237
Right? Because I think, like, me increase, like, not using me increase is probably the biggest, um, sort of thing that contributes to.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.380
Having a lot of this extra geometry.

00:41:18.848 --> 00:41:23.848
But yeah, uh, we want to show you a bit about our progress.

00:41:31.492 --> 00:41:33.492
Okay, let me share.

00:41:31.952 --> 00:41:33.952
Yep, sure, I'll show my… I'll stop sharing.

00:41:48.821 --> 00:41:51.821
Nice. Nice, love the emissives, really cool.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:53.390
Here's our down goal. Who could use a mission map and point lights, so you can turn it on and off.

00:41:57.391 --> 00:42:00.391
Okay, really cool. Um… Nice.

00:42:04.143 --> 00:42:06.143
And then we have… So, it lacks water.

00:42:10.308 --> 00:42:12.308
Yep.

00:42:11.623 --> 00:42:13.623
And then we have… what do we call it?

00:42:16.139 --> 00:42:20.139
Animation we are coding, so if… it will detect terrains.

00:42:23.962 --> 00:42:25.962
Yep.

00:42:25.186 --> 00:42:29.186
Would move, right? According to the theory. Okay.

00:42:27.705 --> 00:42:29.705
Nice, that's really cool. Yeah, I love it. Love it, great job.

00:42:29.977 --> 00:42:34.977
Kinematics. So, there are… if you can see, there are boxes.

00:42:41.103 --> 00:42:43.103
Awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so it's, um, you're doing… I'm assuming you're doing, like, line traces, and it's just detecting where the ground is, like, under that, um, under that bone. Is that what's happening?

00:42:46.799 --> 00:42:48.799
Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, amazing. Great job.

00:42:49.511 --> 00:42:51.511
Okay.

00:42:55.692 --> 00:42:59.692
Uh, thank you very much for your feedback, Gladwell.

00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:03.191
No, no, no, you're welcome. Alright, let me, uh, in that case, let me just share my screen. Sorry.

00:43:13.228 --> 00:43:15.228
Cacious screen… And then… alright. So, next one… next one that I have… okay, um, next… next one that I have is I have the Sugar Glider.

00:43:15.776 --> 00:43:18.776
Now, with the Sugar Glider, I believe that… I don't think the textures came through.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.080
Uh… wait, sorry. Where was it?

00:43:32.763 --> 00:43:34.763
So I'm assuming it's this one. Um, sorry. This Sugar Glider UV Unwrapped, that's the, um… at least that's the one that I've.

00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:44.208
I think… Uh, yeah, not… yeah, from there.

00:43:44.322 --> 00:43:46.322
Sort of found? Why didn't that open? Oh, wait, that's a 1KB, hold on. Am I…

00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:49.659
Uh, oh yep, yep, sorry, my bad. Folder.

00:44:04.293 --> 00:44:10.293
Okay. Alright, yep, so just on my end, the texters didn't come through, so, um, if the team can later show the textures, that'd be… Uh, that'd be great. Now, let me just have a look at the…

00:44:17.044 --> 00:44:22.044
Sorry, my notes… okay. Firstly, really cute design. I think, um… yeah, I like the sort of enlarged head and, you know, the proportions of everything look really cool.

00:44:27.258 --> 00:44:29.258
So, I think a great job on that. Now, the… notes that I had.

00:44:28.926 --> 00:44:39.926
Overall, in terms of the, um, in terms of the topology, generally, I'd say, um, yeah, this, um, this, this definitely works. Something that I would potentially.

00:44:48.507 --> 00:44:54.507
Uh, change is… you've got, like, this edge loop on the tail, which I would probably… And which kind of goes around the entire… Um, it goes on for, like, quite a while. This is something that I would maybe just remove, because I don't think it's actually…

00:44:55.368 --> 00:45:04.368
Um… I don't think it's giving you a lot of benefit, especially here on the, um, especially here on the hands, so maybe just dissolving that might be an idea.

00:45:12.036 --> 00:45:14.036
Another thing is, with the tail. You've got a lot of these edge loops, but you've got these really sort of angular sort of shapes, so what I would do is just…

00:45:17.156 --> 00:45:19.156
Maybe adjust those, smooth them out a little bit. Just to… just to make the tail a little bit more rounded.

00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:30.875
Right? Um, again, but again, like, it's a… I understand that it could be, like, a stylistic choice, so… That's not… that's not necessarily a, uh, like, a bad thing, per se.

00:45:37.776 --> 00:45:40.776
Now, other thing that I… wanted to mention… yes, another thing that I wanted to mention, so with the… with the animations.

00:45:46.072 --> 00:45:48.072
This is fairly minor, but just something to make it. Um, a little bit more…

00:45:50.392 --> 00:45:51.392
Sorry. Uh, wait, which one was it? Was it this one? Yep.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:54.350
Uh, wait, no, I think it was the previous one, this one.

00:46:03.968 --> 00:46:05.968
So, okay, um… I didn't look at references, right? But what kind of stands out to me here with the animation is the back legs.

00:46:10.961 --> 00:46:15.961
Alright, and again, this might be a very minor thing, and to be honest, I might actually be wrong on this, but… Right now, when the character jumps, you've got the back legs kind of folding out.

00:46:16.199 --> 00:46:20.199
That way, right? So they kind of go like that, right?

00:46:19.679 --> 00:46:24.679
Whereas, I think what should be happening is they should be kind of going outwards.

00:46:25.574 --> 00:46:36.574
Instead. Right? Now, again, this just stood out… this stood out to me for, um, when I first saw it, and again, I may be wrong on this, like, maybe when they jumped, that's exactly how they do it.

00:46:35.771 --> 00:46:38.771
But that's just one thing I would potentially have a look at.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:46.130
Um, other than that, really cute, uh, jumping animation. I noticed there's sort of, like, a longer animation that you do have.

00:46:45.777 --> 00:46:52.777
Right? Which… you have it sort of gliding, and you've got the tail flying, so that's really cute.

00:46:56.147 --> 00:46:58.147
And… Bit of a jump animation.

00:46:59.467 --> 00:47:01.467
The jump animation, I would probably have it go a little bit higher.

00:47:05.507 --> 00:47:07.507
Right now, because, um… Oh, it's running… oh, right, okay, so this is.

00:47:05.861 --> 00:47:08.861
It's running, I think? Running. Yeah, Larry, it's running in a name.

00:47:08.135 --> 00:47:13.135
Oh, right, sorry, okay, sorry, my bad then. In that case… wait, let me just go timeline… hold on.

00:47:16.002 --> 00:47:19.002
Are we at 20? Let's just limit the. Just limit the timeline to 20.

00:47:26.344 --> 00:47:33.344
Okay, yeah, yeah, yep, so it is a running animation. With this running… with this running animation, um, one thing I would probably do is… You've got the arms extending really, really fast, right? So that's… that's one thing. Maybe just have them…

00:47:40.595 --> 00:47:43.595
Because there's no change, um… kind of in this direction, from frame 0 to frame 5, but then you've got a really sudden jump to frame 10.

00:47:46.621 --> 00:47:48.621
Right? So having them… Uh… wait, are these IK set up? Yep.

00:47:51.566 --> 00:47:53.566
So, having them move a little bit f-. Further forward by frame 5.

00:47:57.149 --> 00:48:09.149
We'll just help smooth it out a bit, and then do sort of the same thing over here, where you see there's very little change on the y-axis from frame 10 to frame 15, but then it goes back to frame 20 really suddenly, so maybe… Moving that… there?

00:48:14.337 --> 00:48:16.337
We'll just help smooth things out a little bit. Sorry, wait, um, what's the interpolation on this?

00:48:25.393 --> 00:48:27.393
Sorry, it might be an interpolation thing. Um, I'm just gonna…

00:48:26.134 --> 00:48:30.134
Do that, and then easing type, let's just go automatic easing. Wait, will that fix it?

00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:37.663
So why does that…

00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:46.569
Okay, why is that not doing its thing? Hold on.

00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:55.096
Yeah, sorry, it's not adjusting. Wait, what am I missing here?

00:48:58.288 --> 00:49:04.288
Okay, um, yeah, so it's not saving, uh, it's not saving on mine. There's probably something I'm missing with the setup of the project.

00:49:04.127 --> 00:49:11.127
Or something, but basically, yeah, that's what I would change. So from frame 0 to frame 5, there's no movement.

00:49:11.095 --> 00:49:19.095
Over here, but then there's very sudden movement to frame 10, so just have the 5 be somewhere in between frame 0 and frame 10.

00:49:19.605 --> 00:49:25.605
Right? Because you see right now, if I jump from 0 to 5, there's basically no difference. And then from frame 10 to frame 20.

00:49:26.036 --> 00:49:31.036
Have 15 be somewhere in the middle, right? So, because right now you see frame 10 and frame 15, they're in the same spot.

00:49:31.323 --> 00:49:36.323
So, have frame 15 be in between frame 10 and frame 20.

00:49:41.059 --> 00:49:43.059
So, somewhere around there. Right? Um, it's just right now, I'm not… it's not saving the, um…

00:49:47.098 --> 00:49:50.098
The IK positions, but hopefully you get what I mean. Alright, um, other than that, other than that, um, yeah, no notes.

00:49:55.162 --> 00:49:57.162
Um, did the team… did the team have any questions? Well, I wanna, um, let's say, share with the, um, with the touches?

00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:17.262
Uh, sorry? Oh. Is the team going to share their screen, or are we moving?

00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:28.603
Yeah, definitely. Okay, thank you, Gleb. Amy Shop Albani. Assessment, okay.

00:50:25.318 --> 00:50:27.318
Okay. Mm-hmm. Nice to meet you.

00:50:53.981 --> 00:50:57.981
Sorry, is the team sharing their screen, or…? Oh, okay, okay, okay.

00:50:57.502 --> 00:50:59.502
Yeah, wait, uh… It's prepared in the script.

00:51:05.103 --> 00:51:09.103
Okay, I've got, um, yeah, I saw in the chat you sent a link to a… Um, to another… zip file, so…

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.410
I'll just unpack that while… What the screen is showing…

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:16.790
Can you see it? Can you see the screen?

00:51:21.283 --> 00:51:23.283
Uh, my animation.

00:51:22.732 --> 00:51:24.732
Yes, yes I can. Mm-hmm.

00:51:29.342 --> 00:51:31.342
Babe, um… Let's say, uh…

00:51:40.287 --> 00:51:42.287
Nice, Ricket.

00:52:05.193 --> 00:52:10.193
Uh, I'm just using the three key friends, because, uh, for… Looking in unity.

00:52:14.805 --> 00:52:17.805
Right, okay. Yeah, oh, right, all right. Okay, sure.

00:52:16.825 --> 00:52:22.825
Yeah, overall, um, uh, overall looks good. One thing I would do is I would add maybe some movement to the main body.

00:52:23.068 --> 00:52:29.068
Right now, the body is very static, so you only have the legs moving. Maybe have the body sort of, like, you know, maybe bob up and down a little bit.

00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:32.829
While it's moving, um, that might give it a little bit more natural motion.

00:52:38.927 --> 00:52:42.927
But aside from… but aside from that, um, yeah, it's a fairly… Um, with this, you do want a pretty… you probably want a fairly simple walk cycle, so I think that… that's why I think that works.

00:52:46.558 --> 00:52:50.558
And yeah, I can see that you've got… I can see that you've got some textures applied now, so that's really good.

00:53:00.759 --> 00:53:02.759
Do you have anything more to…? Show? Uh…

00:53:06.024 --> 00:53:08.024
Yeah, I think… good.

00:53:13.477 --> 00:53:16.477
Sorry? I didn't catch the last spot. No, no, thank you. Thanks for sharing. All right, let me… alright.

00:53:15.256 --> 00:53:17.256
Yeah, thank you.

00:53:22.475 --> 00:53:25.475
So let's, uh, move on to the… to the next project, so next project…

00:53:26.996 --> 00:53:29.996
Is Sun… sunkanyabird. I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.

00:53:34.393 --> 00:53:37.393
Some cone bird, um, and…

00:53:45.724 --> 00:53:47.724
Okay, one second… Uh, sorry, let me just.

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:58.601
Open up the windows, okay. And then… notes…

00:54:04.835 --> 00:54:06.835
Okay, um, yeah, so with this one. First thing, uh, first thing I want to say, um, in terms of the… in terms of the geometry and the topology, really, really good.

00:54:11.197 --> 00:54:14.197
Um, so… This, uh, fairly, um, you know, every… everything is fairly even.

00:54:14.235 --> 00:54:19.235
And… there's enough edge loops to sort of support deformation, so from that standpoint.

00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:25.843
Everything's really good. I think the design's really cute, and you have these… And you have these bits over here as well, which I thought was really cool.

00:54:25.644 --> 00:54:31.644
Um, just a quick question. So, with this, unless I'm missing something, is there a separate rig for these parts?

00:54:38.897 --> 00:54:41.897
Nice metro.

00:54:41.413 --> 00:54:44.413
Hi, Clev. So, my name is Sabrina. Oh, maybe that's my fault, because I just doubt that…

00:54:50.266 --> 00:54:53.266
The task has to be, um… Separate with the body, but… I have other try to do that, so…

00:54:55.238 --> 00:54:59.238
Now I just work for that. I will, uh… make it just one drive, one rick.

00:55:08.797 --> 00:55:10.797
Okay, alright, fair enough, fair enough. Okay, sorry, yeah, because I wasn't sure if I was missing something, but yeah, I did notice that there were, like, there were basically two rigs here. But yeah, if you're joining them up, um…

00:55:13.185 --> 00:55:22.185
You might have some issues joining them up once you've already created animations, but that's… that's not always the case. Um, you need to be careful with, like, what you're parenting to what.

00:55:27.941 --> 00:55:32.941
Um, but yeah, that was just, like I said, sort of a small technical thing that I wanted to, um… Uh, wanted to sort of figure out. So, yeah, like I said, overall, really like the design.

00:55:32.668 --> 00:55:38.668
Now, um, with this as well, it's really cool that that's, um, that's all separate.

00:55:42.095 --> 00:55:46.095
By the way, in terms of separate, um… in terms of separate… Oh, no, you do have separate bones. Okay, so that's fine.

00:55:54.541 --> 00:55:56.541
So in terms of, um… In terms of notes… wait, there was something that I had notes on about the… I think it was about the materials.

00:56:04.575 --> 00:56:06.575
Sorry. So it's Shader Editor…

00:56:10.407 --> 00:56:12.407
Wait, that's the bird. Sorry, I typed in join materials for some reason, I know I can't figure out why I typed that in.

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.640
Okay, um, I think… alright, never mind. So, let me just go through the… Let me just go to the animations…

00:56:34.164 --> 00:56:36.164
And so you've got a… You've got a run cycle? Yeah, this is actually what, um, this is actually one of the things I wanted to find out. So you've got a run cycle, right? But then you've got some extra, um, stuff over here. I'm assuming that's…

00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:44.151
That's a sort of leftover, so I'm guessing that… It's supposed to grow something like this.

00:56:46.857 --> 00:56:59.857
And I'm not looking at that because I understand that there's a separate rig for that at the moment, right? So, yeah, that's, um, uh… so that's really cool. One thing that maybe I would add with this is, um, some more movement. You've got this tail.

00:56:59.544 --> 00:57:08.544
Right? And the fact that it's kind of moving from side to side, that's really cool. Me, personally, I would probably have it, like, move even more, so, like, just, like, more wildly, kind of, like, swing from side to side.

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:19.590
Because you've got, like, these bits up over here, so it's a very sort of whimsical character. It's, um, you know, it looks like it's… it should be really, really… kind of expressively animated, so I would just add some more…

00:57:19.593 --> 00:57:26.593
Um, I would add a little bit more movement to this. But, um, the overall direction and all of that, I think, is really cool. It's really good.

00:57:34.621 --> 00:57:36.621
Um… Okay, so… wait, with this one, hold on…

00:57:36.842 --> 00:57:39.842
So this is just more of a kind of, like, slow animation.

00:57:44.857 --> 00:57:48.857
With this as well, so, um, you've got a little bit of extra head movement in… from the… from… from this… From frame 10 to frame 14.

00:57:49.285 --> 00:57:52.285
Um, that's just something I would remove, but aside from that.

00:57:57.642 --> 00:58:06.642
What I would do here is, again, just maybe some more expressiveness. So I would add, like, more bobbing up and down, you know, kind of more, uh… just, like, more, I'd say… a bigger range of motion, um, than you have right now. The motion itself is really good, but I would add more of a range.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:23.030
Um, jump… Jump, as well, sort of same thing, great direction, I think the animation's really good. Um, one thing that you have really… that is really common, actually, um, when you're starting out animating, you've got the feet sliding back before the jump.

00:58:23.476 --> 00:58:26.476
So that shouldn't… that technically shouldn't happen, but that's a very minor thing.

00:58:30.146 --> 00:58:33.146
And with this, what I would also do is… so you have this… kind of anticipation over here, right, before the jump.

00:58:37.124 --> 00:58:39.124
Again, just like with the… If I can find whichever… whatever the correct sort of rig here is.

00:58:45.656 --> 00:58:47.656
Um, I would even have this, kind of. Go down a lot lower, right, than it is right now, and um…

00:58:49.504 --> 00:58:51.504
You know, just to add a little bit more… kind of a little bit more movement.

00:58:50.893 --> 00:58:58.893
Alright, so just to kind of emphasize. So that's basically my big, uh… that's basically my main, sort of, bit of feedback for all this. Uh, really love it.

00:59:04.737 --> 00:59:07.737
I would emphasize the movement more. That's it. Also, love the, uh, love the hand-painted, um, texturing. Really cool.

00:59:17.614 --> 00:59:19.614
No, they're good, thanks for sharing.

00:59:17.684 --> 00:59:19.684
Okay, thank you, Glad. Is there any question? No? Okay. Thank you, Glev and Jess.

00:59:23.244 --> 00:59:27.244
6 already put the project in… Zoom chat.

00:59:27.282 --> 00:59:29.282
Thanks. Okay.

00:59:34.917 --> 00:59:37.917
Wonderful, thank you, that was… that was great. Really could see this amazing work, and I appreciate, um, Gleb's reflections there on… on how they're progressing.

00:59:38.111 --> 00:59:42.111
That's wonderful, and we'll be meeting with the mentors a little bit later this afternoon.

00:59:44.407 --> 00:59:48.407
Sorry, are we ending now? Or are we going through the rest?

00:59:46.485 --> 00:59:48.485
Yeah.

00:59:52.507 --> 00:59:55.507
Sorry, you've still got… sorry, Glib, I am… I'm, um… cutting off half an hour early. Go ahead.

00:59:54.699 --> 00:59:59.699
Oh, no, no, no, sorry, I thought that I missed something.

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:02.250
Alright, so, um, we'll move on to the next project, then?

01:00:05.155 --> 01:00:13.155
Okay, Group 6, alright. Um, uh, yeah, if we've got… so if we've got half an hour, um, so, like, I can… I can go on a little bit longer.

01:00:05.986 --> 01:00:08.986
Yeah, we can move to Group 6, heck?

01:00:15.815 --> 01:00:22.815
But, um, just up to you in terms of timing, what works for you, because if we've got just half an hour, we might need to… be a little bit quicker with the… with the… with the next ones.

01:00:26.531 --> 01:00:28.531
I'll just… yeah, we… still have a lot of time.

01:00:33.981 --> 01:00:36.981
Okay, cool. Alright, great. Uh, let me… hold on. So the next is the Hedgehog. So this, um, I haven't seen… I haven't opened this yet, because this is the one that was just sent to me.

01:00:43.442 --> 01:00:46.442
So… okay, alright, here's wrong. Cool. Alright, so looking at… so looking at this, um, first of all, love the design, really, really cute.

01:00:46.354 --> 01:00:51.354
Uh, love the quills as well. Um, I believe the other hedgehog was done with very similar quills as well.

01:00:51.532 --> 01:00:56.532
Alright, so I'm sure the groups are sort of trading secrets, quill secrets.

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:08.525
Stands out to me. This is a very minor thing, but everything is marked, um… you've got hard edges everywhere.

01:01:01.711 --> 01:01:03.711
Uh, that's good to see. Now. Something immediately that sort of, um…

01:01:13.497 --> 01:01:16.497
Right? So, just shading everything smooth.

01:01:14.775 --> 01:01:22.775
Um, I mean, I'm guessing that this is probably, um, more with more in line with what you wanted.

01:01:23.253 --> 01:01:26.253
Um, so that, yeah, that's the first thing, just shading smooth.

01:01:29.389 --> 01:01:33.389
Right, um, next thing is… let me just have a look at the… geometry here.

01:01:37.626 --> 01:01:43.626
Okay, again, subdivided, um, neatly subdivided, so… I don't think there are any engines here, let me just check.

01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:53.231
Greater than… Nope. Now I'm gone, so that, yeah, um, uh, very nicely sort of modeled.

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:58.502
And subdivided. So, yeah, no notes on the topology over here.

01:01:59.671 --> 01:02:06.671
I would maybe add a couple more loops to the feet if they deform a lot, but I'm honestly guessing that they probably don't, so that might not be necessary.

01:02:12.603 --> 01:02:14.603
Uh, let me just move this back down… And then let's just have a look. Oh, right, so that's… wait, is that a shape key? Yep, that is a shape key.

01:02:18.848 --> 01:02:22.848
Oh, uh, that's driven by something. Wait, how do you un… There's a way to unpreview this. What is that way?

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:33.582
Alright, I'll just view it this way, never mind. Um… Okay, alright, so that's what you've done. You've basically got a shape key where these are kind of, um, pushing out.

01:02:38.778 --> 01:02:40.778
Okay, that's cool. Okay, something… something to do with shape keys, this is a technical thing, this is more of a technical thing.

01:02:46.794 --> 01:02:48.794
And, um… when you… when you have, um… when you have an animated character.

01:02:50.026 --> 01:02:55.026
Um, be very careful about creating shape keys before everything is joined together.

01:02:58.237 --> 01:03:09.237
Because sometimes, if you create shape keys, but then join objects together, that can lead to… that can lead to problems. So, it may not lead to a problem here, like, for example, if I merge all this together… And then we just have a look at the shape key.

01:03:08.963 --> 01:03:13.963
Yep, so that's fine here, but sometimes things like that can break.

01:03:14.192 --> 01:03:18.192
Right? So that's just my suggestion, where, um, if you're creating shape keys.

01:03:19.142 --> 01:03:26.142
Especially if you need to do a lot of work on them, make sure you've got your entire model, um, there, like, that is going to be merged into one object.

01:03:31.634 --> 01:03:36.634
This… yep, that's fine. So, yeah, I can see these were, sort of.

01:03:31.673 --> 01:03:33.673
Um, before, before you do the shape keys. So, uh, let's just have a look at…

01:03:44.104 --> 01:03:46.104
Triangulated, but that's completely fine. And then, let's just have a look at the animations…

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:50.830
So, consume.

01:03:49.981 --> 01:03:55.981
Okay… nice, you've got that kind of moving out to the side, got the butt wiggle, really cool.

01:03:59.128 --> 01:04:05.128
Nice. Uh, let's have a look at the other animations. Curl, what is… oh, right, okay, so it's like a… It's like an actual hedgehog thing.

01:04:08.154 --> 01:04:14.154
Nice, cute. One, uh… so this, he, um, it sticks its head, like, into the ground, basically.

01:04:13.805 --> 01:04:19.805
With this, maybe just have it, like, sort of lift up and then kind of curl more into a ball, um, into itself, but aside from that, that's really cool.

01:04:24.376 --> 01:04:26.376
Um, idle animation…

01:04:27.972 --> 01:04:30.972
Okay, nice, we've got the target, looking around. Yeah, with a little sniffle, that's cool.

01:04:37.542 --> 01:04:40.542
Um… sorry, let me just… timeline… what is that? That's frame 30.

01:04:40.707 --> 01:04:44.707
Wait, that's frame 28, so we need to end at 27.

01:04:50.457 --> 01:04:56.457
Um, yeah, this is just a minor thing, but if you've got a looping animation, you actually want it to… like, if you're previewing it, you want it to end… one frame before the last frame.

01:04:56.778 --> 01:05:00.778
Otherwise, you get a pause at the end. So, if we go frame 28.

01:05:03.135 --> 01:05:07.135
The… like, it's gonna be barely visible, but there's technically gonna be a little bit of a pause there.

01:05:10.331 --> 01:05:13.331
Alright, um, so… Nice.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.700
Yep, really cute. Sneak…

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:35.510
With the sneaking, um, with the sneaking, really cool. I would probably, um, have him lower down a little bit, because… If… right now, I don't think there's too much of a difference between walking and sneaking, but with sneaking, you know, like, you're assuming that he's trying to be a little bit more hidden.

01:05:36.241 --> 01:05:38.241
So that's just a small… that's just a very, uh, small thing.

01:05:39.675 --> 01:05:43.675
Uncurl. Okay, so that's just… I'm assuming this is just a reverse of the… curl animation.

01:05:45.871 --> 01:05:47.871
Yep. Okay… And then you've got another walk.

01:05:48.676 --> 01:05:52.676
Put the walk, um, just, uh, just make sure you've got, you've got them tilted.

01:05:52.886 --> 01:05:57.886
So that's just, like, that's a very minor thing, so you just need to… whatever you've got.

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:03.730
Sorry. Whatever is controlling the main bodies, that… no, not that, not that.

01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:11.636
Um… I don't know if that was tilted, but yeah, you can sort of see… that, um, front paws are higher than the back.

01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:17.386
So it just needs to be, kind of, twisted a little bit. Other than that, um, love the design, really cute.

01:06:16.858 --> 01:06:21.858
Northern Oats. Um, do the team want to share anything, or, um, have any questions?

01:06:26.448 --> 01:06:28.448
Yep, Team 6. Do you have any question, or…?

01:06:31.915 --> 01:06:33.915
Something you want to ask? Press the button.

01:06:37.635 --> 01:06:39.635
Oh, okay, uh… I don't know, I think we're good.

01:06:43.836 --> 01:06:46.836
Thank you, Corey. Glenn.

01:06:44.686 --> 01:06:45.686
You good? All good. Well, thanks for sharing, really cute.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:57.711
Um, just look at the eyes. Yeah, really good. All right, um, cool. Alright, in that case, we'll move on to the… move on to the next project. So we've got Team.

01:07:01.771 --> 01:07:03.771
Sneak the hamster.

01:07:05.538 --> 01:07:08.538
Okay, with this one, it actually took me a second to find the hamster.

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:19.970
Um, so, hold on. Okay, one thing here… And… wait, let me just…

01:07:23.447 --> 01:07:26.447
Uh, hold on… join left. So, one thing that…

01:07:33.111 --> 01:07:36.111
Sort of first thing that I'd want to mention. This, uh… it sometimes matters, it sometimes doesn't, like, um, well, again, it's depending on what this is for.

01:07:41.372 --> 01:07:48.372
But the scale of everything is really, really big, right? So that's just, um, that's just one thing that, uh… that I noticed, that… You know, if we bring in this cube, this is a…

01:07:51.783 --> 01:07:56.783
What Inblender is a… it's a 2 meter queue by default. Yeah, it's in Unreal that is 1 meter. Um… Yeah, so this is a 2 meter cube, so this is, like, an absolutely giant hamster.

01:08:06.748 --> 01:08:13.748
Right? Which, by itself, is not necessarily a problem, it's… but the only issue is that if you then want to, like, let's say take it to an, um… to a game engine, you probably want to… sort of maintain the correct sizing. Or, the alternative is you have to always convert it, um, you have to, like, scale it down or scale it up.

01:08:13.835 --> 01:08:18.835
Uh, when you're taking it into a game engine, right? So, again, it's a minor thing.

01:08:29.327 --> 01:08:32.327
But, um, just something to keep in mind. So, uh, with the… with the environment itself, it's really cool that you've got, like, an entire, sort of, environment actually built out here, and I noticed that you have…

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:37.111
Sure. That's taking a while to, um… to figure out the shaders.

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:45.779
Okay. Yeah, so I noticed you also have this, like, waiting cat, which is really cool.

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:54.916
And… yeah, the environment, really cute that you've got this, um, uh, that you've got this entire sort of, like, environment built out for this.

01:09:02.043 --> 01:09:06.043
Thought that was cute. Now, the hamster itself, let me… Let me just have a look… sorry, let me move…

01:09:05.381 --> 01:09:10.381
Let me just hide everything else, and you've got the rig as well, I believe.

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:26.430
Okay. The rig… the rig, a little bit more complicated than it needs to be, but I understand that this is a sort of, uh… this is sort of a default one. Um… Okay. So, overall, the design, um, the design of the hamster.

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:34.462
Very hamstery, so no notes on, like, the actual… Overall design, really cute, um…

01:09:43.356 --> 01:09:46.356
You know, typical sort of, like, cute kind of design. So that's cool. In terms of the topology and what other notes that I had, let me just have a look. Hamster…

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:53.417
Uh, sorry, there was something about the animations…

01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:58.749
Oh, yeah. Um, with the animation, so at the moment, I'm just seeing… I believe it's just this animation, this sort of, like, sniffing animation.

01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:05.310
Um, unless I'm missing something. There's nothing… there's nothing else that I, um, that I saw, at least.

01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:12.554
Hello, ma'am. And, uh, we used the blender fashion.

01:10:11.323 --> 01:10:13.323
Heck.

01:10:17.157 --> 01:10:20.157
4.5, so there is something hidden here.

01:10:25.576 --> 01:10:27.576
Oh, right, okay, um… Okay, in that case… in that case, let me just, um… I'll just comment on, sort of, like, the topology and geometry, and maybe you can just share your screen, and we'll have a look there.

01:10:33.154 --> 01:10:37.154
Alright, so, let me just see… what did I… Uh, what did I have as notes? Yeah, overall, that's… let me just hide the rig.

01:10:41.703 --> 01:10:45.703
Overall, the geometry, um, like, the topology is… is completely, um, is completely fine.

01:10:55.274 --> 01:10:59.274
Something that, um, again, this is… this is more of a stylistic choice, but… I don't… Um, I don't think that there's too much of a benefit from having, like, the separate clause.

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:07.700
Right? You can have slightly simpler geometry if you kind of just merge all of that, and, um, you know, it's doubtful how much that will actually be visible.

01:11:07.933 --> 01:11:14.933
On the, uh, you know, in, like, let's say final animations or final models, just having that as sort of, like, more of a mitten kind of thing.

01:11:19.011 --> 01:11:21.011
I think that, uh, I think that could work. Other than that, um…

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:24.620
With the eyes, you can make them a bit simpler, but that's a very minor thing.

01:11:30.041 --> 01:11:34.041
Right? The UVs as well, I'm not sure if… Uh, yeah, I did have a look at… I did have a look at the…

01:11:39.118 --> 01:11:42.118
Um, at the textures, and… With the textures, the UVs, um…

01:11:45.641 --> 01:11:49.641
This is a… this is… I'd say it's… It's generally a good layout, but…

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:53.380
There are some sort of things that, um, you could maybe do a little bit.

01:11:58.665 --> 01:12:03.665
Uh, that you could maybe do a little bit differently. One thing is, if you have a… If you have this sort of, like, um… loop of seams.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.030
Around the… sort of around the eyes.

01:12:19.745 --> 01:12:22.745
Um, you probably would want, then. Just the inside to be black, but not the outside. When you do this, what will happen is you will get this, uh, you will get these kind of visible seams on these edges, and it will be more visible than in other areas. So, like, over here.

01:12:23.695 --> 01:12:29.695
Right? So, especially if this is painted on, I don't think that there's too much of a point to having this sort of thing as a separate edge loop.

01:12:28.731 --> 01:12:34.731
Right? I'll probably just have this… have this be all together. Um, with the ears as well.

01:12:35.275 --> 01:12:42.275
They're… because you don't really have any cuts over here, you've got a lot less, sort of, texture space to work with on the ears.

01:12:41.749 --> 01:12:48.749
Relative to, you know, like, other parts of the body. So you can sort of compare, like, this face over here.

01:12:49.301 --> 01:12:54.301
On the 3D model is roughly the same size as these two, but you see over here, that's, um, that's very small.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:58.953
So, you know, just, um, uh, I would potentially adjust that a little bit.

01:13:05.713 --> 01:13:06.713
But, other than that… Um, other than that… Uh… other than that, really cute.

01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:10.010
Very good. So, I don't know if the team wants to share their screen.

01:13:14.121 --> 01:13:16.121
We can have a look.

01:13:16.085 --> 01:13:20.085
Yeah. Yeah, I will also…

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:22.021
Mm-hmm.

01:13:59.087 --> 01:14:04.087
Yeah, so sorry about me having an older version of Blender. I generally don't update unless I need to…

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:07.573
Here is some animation idol, and… Uh, we have a lock animation.

01:14:07.005 --> 01:14:13.005
Cool. Sorry, do you mind just, um, hiding the rig itself? Because it's a little bit difficult to just see.

01:14:19.643 --> 01:14:21.643
Yep, cheers.

01:14:35.894 --> 01:14:44.894
So when you're working with the action editor, I generally have, like, the bottom, um, so at the bottom, you have that, um, uh, you have another view. I would potentially just change that to a timeline.

01:14:53.285 --> 01:14:55.285
Unless, unless you're moving in between animations there. Just so you can, like, figure… just so you can change the endpoints, but again, that's just more of a workflow thing.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.900
Okay, um, yeah, can you show the, uh, yep, Chelsea? Nice.

01:15:09.015 --> 01:15:11.015
No, it's a good range of movement, that's cool.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.800
Yep, uh, so with this one, it's a little bit… Um… it looks a little bit like stop motion, so maybe have a little bit more smoothness between those frames, especially in the head, like, the head looks like it's just kind of…

01:15:27.921 --> 01:15:30.921
Um, very suddenly going forward, and then suddenly going back. That's, uh… but again, that's…

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.420
That's fairly…

01:15:40.183 --> 01:15:42.183
It's fairly minor. Overall, it's really good.

01:15:51.569 --> 01:15:53.569
And he has a… that he had mentioned.

01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:57.295
Okay. Is that a, um… is that morph targets, or is that bones?

01:16:02.237 --> 01:16:04.237
It… Uh, with the bullets, yeah.

01:16:03.777 --> 01:16:05.777
Sorry, sorry, shaped easel bones.

01:16:09.302 --> 01:16:11.302
Okay, that's what… that's what the bonus. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, you can do it with other. Cool. Nice.

01:16:20.782 --> 01:16:22.782
So, something… this is just more of a, um… Uh, this is just more of a general note, it's not specific to this.

01:16:22.905 --> 01:16:27.905
But if you're doing, um… so when you're doing all sorts of locomotion animations.

01:16:32.533 --> 01:16:34.533
Right, below commotion, I mean all sorts of movement, so… you know, running, walking, jumping, sneaking, um, etc.

01:16:35.352 --> 01:16:41.352
Uh, if you're doing jumping, if you're doing jumping specifically, it sometimes makes sense if you… especially if you want to put this in a game.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:45.721
To have 3 different animations. So, one of them being the start of your jump.

01:16:51.312 --> 01:16:55.312
Right? The next one being a folding animation, and the next one being a… Um, a landing jump. Sorry, a landing animation. So…

01:16:55.027 --> 01:17:05.027
Again, this is not… so what you've done here, what you've done here is really good, but, um, the reason to sometimes have it be three separate animations is, let's say if you jump off a really high.

01:17:04.969 --> 01:17:15.969
Area, right? Like, let's say you jump off, you know, um, like, let's say it's the top, like, this hamster jumps off the top of the staircase, and it flies, like, you know, it falls for, like, let's say 2 seconds, and then it lands.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:23.680
Right? You might want to have, like, let's say the start of an animation, and then basically the… Um, while it is still in the air.

01:17:24.231 --> 01:17:32.231
Right? You have a sort of falling animation where it's kind of, you know, flapping its arms or whatever, and then you have a landing animation for when it actually hits the ground. So that is something that's kind of commonly done.

01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:41.341
But that's not really a note for this, it's just a general note, kind of for everyone. If you want to put your… Jumping animations into a game, then, uh, you sometimes do have to break them up into sort of smaller bits.

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:49.810
Other than that, looks really good. Mm-hmm. Yes.

01:17:51.469 --> 01:17:53.469
Thank you.

01:17:56.321 --> 01:18:00.321
Okay, um, alright, in that case, I'll… Yeah, if you can stop sharing, I'll share my screen as well, we'll move on to…

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.909
The… We've got the guinea pig.

01:18:11.335 --> 01:18:13.335
Let me just open that on my end. Guinea pig…

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:24.375
Sorry, everything's just loading.

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:41.590
Sorry, give me one second, just got a bit of a… Belinda's taking its time. Alright, yep.

01:18:51.664 --> 01:18:53.664
Sharing… And then… sorry, just one second…

01:18:51.831 --> 01:18:57.831
Okay, so with this one, again, I don't believe the textures came through.

01:19:09.221 --> 01:19:11.221
Right? Um, I think… Yeah, I don't think that… I don't think that any, um… I don't think the textures came through, came through on this model, but I'll just give my, um, I'll just give my overall…

01:19:15.943 --> 01:19:20.943
Overall thoughts? Oh, yeah, one thing I wanted to mention is with this… with this hedgehog, I did notice, because there were two blend files, there was an environment and the…

01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:25.729
Um, and the actual animation with the blend file. Uh, sorry, with the environment, really cool.

01:19:33.527 --> 01:19:35.527
Really cool environment, love the design. So I think it's because I've got OBS and I'm sharing my screen, and I've got several Blender projects open, it's just being a little bit slow.

01:19:38.849 --> 01:19:41.849
Uh… let me… Turn off face orientation.

01:19:51.248 --> 01:19:53.248
Yeah, so I thought… I thought this was really cool. Um, you know, having the… I'm assuming that finally the guinea pig is gonna be here, and he's gonna be doing some, um…

01:19:56.677 --> 01:19:58.677
Some kind of religious… thing, maybe? Or anti-religious thing?

01:20:00.731 --> 01:20:04.731
Oh, it's a devil guinea pig, so he's gonna burn down the church. Alright.

01:20:02.917 --> 01:20:04.917
It's, uh… Yeah, it's a difficult guinea pig, so…

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:12.540
Nice, alright. Um, I'm just, you know, just… I'm guessing at a certain point, the cross is just gonna go like that, or something.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.136
Yeah…

01:20:12.694 --> 01:20:20.694
Right? Uh, just turn upside down once the guinea pig appears. But yeah, um, really cool, uh, really cool design of the environment.

01:20:23.502 --> 01:20:26.502
Alright, so with the… with the actual… With the actual guinea pig.

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:33.284
So, overall, the… in terms of the geometry. Oops, sorry.

01:20:34.419 --> 01:20:40.419
So, in terms of the actual geometry, um, in terms of the actual geometry, pretty good. I would probably add a few more.

01:20:39.784 --> 01:20:44.784
Edge loops over here, so you generally want to keep things fairly even.

01:20:44.623 --> 01:20:48.623
Right? Um, something else that you could do, as well is, you know.

01:20:50.857 --> 01:20:53.857
Again, depending on how much this is actually… Oh, that's going down the bottom.

01:20:58.484 --> 01:21:00.484
Depending on how much this is. Deforming, you know, just kind of sliding…

01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:05.902
That edge a little bit back. Right, could make things… it could sort of help even… even things out a little bit, right?

01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:11.378
Uh, other than that, um, I remember… I remember last time that I saw.

01:21:10.742 --> 01:21:15.742
The submissions, um… you guys were doing the… you guys were doing the horns.

01:21:15.854 --> 01:21:23.854
So, this part over here could probably be adjusted somewhat. Now, again, I'd have to look at this sort of animations that you're doing.

01:21:27.173 --> 01:21:29.173
But maybe sort of having a… Maybe having a loop there.

01:21:33.331 --> 01:21:41.331
And then having another edge loop kind of go from this, sort of in this direction, if that sort of makes sense, uh, might just fix a few of these sort of, um… shading issues over here. So when you have these really thin triangles.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:49.780
Like this. They sometimes lead to the shading looking a little bit weird, right? But again, that's a fairly minor thing.

01:21:55.461 --> 01:22:00.461
Now, something else… something else? So you've got the… you've got basically these holes, um, in the, uh, like, in the eyes, and I do understand that.

01:22:06.838 --> 01:22:09.838
You've got the eyelids and the eyes covering them, but… me, personally, I would probably close these up, just in case, you know, there's some movement and, like, light starts shining through or something.

01:22:13.131 --> 01:22:17.131
Because it's a very minor thing, it doesn't need to be UV unwrapped properly or anything, but… Um, I would probably do that.

01:22:16.619 --> 01:22:20.619
Now, uh… let's see, wait, what else, what else was there?

01:22:32.438 --> 01:22:34.438
Yeah, okay, the next is to do more with the… The next is to do more with the weights. So, what I noticed is with the weights, there are… there are some issues. So if we have a look at the…

01:22:35.062 --> 01:22:42.062
If we have a look at the animations, right, the main issue with the weights right now is down here at the bottom, because.

01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:51.790
So, if we… look at the white painting, right? If you look at the actual stomach area.

01:22:55.803 --> 01:22:58.803
I'm just gonna cycle through all of these.

01:23:00.784 --> 01:23:05.784
So the stomach area doesn't appear anywhere, so what that means is, and, like, this is how I noticed.

01:23:08.903 --> 01:23:10.903
Is… If we lift this guy up…

01:23:10.249 --> 01:23:13.249
Right? You've got the stomach and, like, the chest sort of left there.

01:23:13.035 --> 01:23:18.035
Right? So, just make sure that everything is, um, everything is weight painted.

01:23:18.075 --> 01:23:25.075
Right? Because by default, if you don't assign weights to something, um, I'm guessing that this was probably also manually weight painted.

01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:36.230
Maybe? Um, but if it was, just make sure to… that everything at least has some influence, because if it has zero influence by any bone, then it will just kind of stay in its place.

01:23:39.175 --> 01:23:44.175
Like so, and you get this really kind of… I mean, it does fit the idea of a devil… Um, hamster even more, but still.

01:23:50.284 --> 01:23:54.284
Okay, so that's one thing. Now… whatever. Sir, wait, we have…

01:23:53.636 --> 01:23:58.636
Okay. Yes, this is the other thing that I wanted to mention. So, with the walking animation.

01:23:59.870 --> 01:24:02.870
Um, also with these, I'm not 100% sure which of these is the correct one.

01:24:04.397 --> 01:24:08.397
Um, walking for… walking 3, let me just check that one.

01:24:15.362 --> 01:24:18.362
Okay, I'm just gonna go… I'm just gonna go zero walking.

01:24:18.896 --> 01:24:24.896
Alright. So, with this, this is also, um, this is also something that people do fairly commonly.

01:24:25.577 --> 01:24:30.577
So, if you have a look at the head, and how it's kind of moving up and down throughout this animation.

01:24:36.985 --> 01:24:38.985
Right? You'll notice that, okay, we've got… step, and then…

01:24:39.904 --> 01:24:42.904
Step… so, you've got… Like, if we have a look at, for example, this leg.

01:24:45.683 --> 01:24:48.683
Right? It moves forward, and then it moves back. From frame 0 to frame 12.

01:24:52.128 --> 01:24:56.128
Right? But within the, um… But within that time, the head basically moves up and then moves down.

01:24:58.787 --> 01:25:03.787
Right? So, if you have this, um, if you have a look at walk cycles, and… Let me just go walk cycle.

01:25:07.846 --> 01:25:10.846
Don't mind turned on.

01:25:09.823 --> 01:25:12.823
Alright, so if you have a look at a walk cycle.

01:25:12.994 --> 01:25:20.994
Um, generally, you have, like, this kind of movement up and down, like, you know, of the torso and the head, right? The thing is that that happens in between every step.

01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:26.810
Right? So, what you've got at the moment is you've got it every, sort of.

01:25:34.175 --> 01:25:36.175
You know, it goes… the head goes up. On one step, and down on the next one. And this kind of makes it look as though it's not working properly, like, you know, maybe one of its legs is hurt.

01:25:36.577 --> 01:25:42.577
Right? So what you generally want to do instead is actually have it kind of move up in between every step, right?

01:25:49.127 --> 01:25:51.127
Um, wait, is it this one? Which… which one is actually…

01:25:54.365 --> 01:25:56.365
So, if I… go, for example… so you see how the head's moving up?

01:26:02.633 --> 01:26:05.633
Here, but then down here. Uh, let me just see…

01:26:06.255 --> 01:26:09.255
So we've got a rig as well. Um, I think, like.

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:12.998
Wait, or is that what's moving? Oh, yeah, that is what's moving.

01:26:17.802 --> 01:26:20.802
So, what I would do is… I would just copy its position.

01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:27.861
From here, where is the…

01:26:33.485 --> 01:26:35.485
So that's the spine IK.

01:26:37.277 --> 01:26:42.277
So, what I would do is I would actually have it bob, go up in between these frames, like so.

01:26:47.758 --> 01:26:49.758
So, more like this.

01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:56.708
So you see where it kind of goes up and down in between every step, as opposed to every second step, if that sort of makes sense.

01:26:56.825 --> 01:27:01.825
Now, um, okay, I understand it's kind of lopsided now, but if you look at it from the side.

01:27:11.554 --> 01:27:13.554
Hopefully you can see, sort of, what I mean. So this would actually be more, um, kind of more regular. But yeah, the main thing here is just fixing the…

01:27:12.756 --> 01:27:17.756
Fixing the weights on the bottom, because right now, if we have a look at the weights over here.

01:27:23.396 --> 01:27:25.396
So there were some issues over there as well. Sorry, let me just…

01:27:23.534 --> 01:27:31.534
Find it. Yeah, so, like, for example, over there, the forearm, you see how that's, like, affecting this very weirdly? You generally want a very smooth transition.

01:27:36.971 --> 01:27:38.971
Yeah, okay. Other than that, really cool. Um, did the team want to share anything?

01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:46.001
Okay, so, uh, actually. Uh, I've been working on the animation.

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:52.870
Nice. Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah, it's a little bit quiet, but yes, I can hear.

01:27:54.266 --> 01:27:56.266
Can you hear the voice? I think you need to speak louder. Oh, okay.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.280
So, uh, I've been working on my… Uh, can you imagine lately?

01:28:05.706 --> 01:28:09.706
Maybe I will show my English on…

01:28:07.059 --> 01:28:09.059
All right. Yeah, sure, let's see.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.420
Like, dude, I don't know.

01:28:25.874 --> 01:28:29.874
Okay, hold on, let me just… wait, let me just move this onto my other screen, because I'm recording.

01:28:32.737 --> 01:28:45.737
Cool. Yeah, that looks, um, that looks better. So, um, still though, what I would maybe do is, because right now you've basically got him… so what's happening is, you know, he steps on his right front right foot.

01:28:47.402 --> 01:28:52.402
And he looks to the left, and then he steps on his left front foot, and he looks to the… and he looks to the right.

01:29:00.605 --> 01:29:03.605
Right? So, um, it's… It's not… it's not bad. What I would maybe do is, I would maybe have more, like, kind of body movement from side to side, but have the…

01:29:02.044 --> 01:29:11.044
Head kind of looking more straight, right? It might just give it a little bit more directionality, because it now kind of looks like he's constantly moving from, like, kind of looking from side to side.

01:29:11.094 --> 01:29:14.094
Right? But again, that's a very minor thing. Overall, it looks really good.

01:29:20.092 --> 01:29:22.092
I need 3 muscle one. Sure. Like, I mean.

01:29:25.795 --> 01:29:28.795
Sorry, say again, please?

01:29:26.902 --> 01:29:34.902
Yeah, their team will show the second environment. The first one is charts, I think the… Yeah.

01:29:34.454 --> 01:29:37.454
Oh, there's a second environment, okay, yeah, sure, sure, totally.

01:29:45.115 --> 01:29:49.115
Oh, nice. Is the… is the church going to transform into this, or…?

01:29:46.175 --> 01:29:48.175
So it's probably gonna look like…

01:29:53.006 --> 01:29:55.006
How does that work?

01:29:56.529 --> 01:29:58.529
It's… We're gonna have, uh, two different… environment, but an opposite environment.

01:30:09.058 --> 01:30:12.058
Okay, right. Nice. Isn't that really cool? You should, um… add some, um… maybe add, like, some flame, sort of like flipbooks and stuff like that on the background.

01:30:11.598 --> 01:30:14.598
And I'd just like to… just to sell the scene even more.

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:19.420
That'll look really cool. Yeah, really cool, really cool environment.

01:30:26.339 --> 01:30:28.339
Is there anything you want to ask ourselves?

01:30:30.076 --> 01:30:32.076
All good? All good, all good. Okay, thank you.

01:30:35.398 --> 01:30:37.398
Awesome. Thanks for sharing. That's really cool.

01:30:37.425 --> 01:30:39.425
Thank you, Team 8. No, I think we can move in 9.

01:30:43.016 --> 01:30:46.016
Okay. Alright. Sure, let's do it. Alright, so…

01:30:45.323 --> 01:30:47.323
It will stop salespeople? Thank you.

01:30:51.663 --> 01:30:54.663
Okay, so I'm just gonna share, and… We've got…

01:30:58.901 --> 01:31:00.901
Alright, team 9… Team 9, it's…

01:31:04.013 --> 01:31:07.013
A hedgehog as well… sorry, hold on, let me just… Because there's a… There's a whole set of folders.

01:31:09.987 --> 01:31:15.987
Okay, yeah, so I believe this is what I got. I don't think I got the… I don't think I got the textures with it.

01:31:20.710 --> 01:31:23.710
Unless I'm… unless I'm mistaken.

01:31:24.327 --> 01:31:28.327
Yeah, that is a texture for…

01:31:33.199 --> 01:31:35.199
One sec… Yeah, because there's base body material, but yeah, I don't think… I don't think… I don't think that was…

01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:38.149
Packaged in… Sorry, unless I'm missing something.

01:31:42.053 --> 01:31:46.053
Yeah, I think they can share… share screen later.

01:31:43.944 --> 01:31:49.944
Okay, alright, yeah, sure. In that case, um, yeah, we'll focus on the taxes, just look at… I'll just look at the topology and the, um… I believe there were some animations here as well.

01:31:56.857 --> 01:31:59.857
So… sorry, let me just put up my notes… Okay, so first of all, in terms of the design, really cute design, love the eyes.

01:32:10.456 --> 01:32:14.456
Um, yeah, so I noticed both teams with the Hedgehogs. Did the same thing with the, um, did the same things with the quills, so that's really cool. Um, oh, and you guys also have a… yeah, you also have a morph target. Alright, I didn't notice that when I was looking at this.

01:32:18.343 --> 01:32:20.343
Alright, so we also have a morph target, that's cool. Um, with the morph target, sorry, with the shape key.

01:32:20.431 --> 01:32:24.431
I would probably move it a little bit more. Like, right now, it's very, very slight.

01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:29.669
So, I would maybe. Um, I would maybe exaggerate that movement by quite a bit.

01:32:34.512 --> 01:32:48.512
But, um… but yeah, that's, uh, that is a really good approach. So, another thing that I noticed on this… on this character as well, and again, this is an extremely easy… easy fix, but just in case, um, you don't notice, you've got… a lot of, um… you've got a lot of these random, sort of, hard edges.

01:32:56.686 --> 01:33:00.686
Right? So, like, for example, over here and over here, which… Um, I'm guessing probably shouldn't be… shouldn't be hard. You've got this as well, which, um, I understand, like, maybe some of these…

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:09.622
Some of these were deliberate, but, like, with some of these, like, for example, those I doubt it, so… With that, you know, just shading everything smooth and…

01:33:12.141 --> 01:33:15.141
Um, oh, wait, one sec, have you got it as a…

01:33:19.533 --> 01:33:21.533
Nope, just shade smooth. Yep, shade smooth, and…

01:33:24.829 --> 01:33:27.829
Just removing the sharps. Now, I understand there might be some shop, um, faces that you want to keep.

01:33:27.776 --> 01:33:34.776
Right? But, um, some of the… some of these, like, for example, these ones, they look a little bit random. So that's just one thing.

01:33:35.157 --> 01:33:38.157
Other than that, let's see, what did I… what did I put in?

01:33:44.815 --> 01:33:46.815
Um… Sorry, that's my notes. Yeah, another thing, you've got these really close edge loops.

01:33:47.469 --> 01:33:54.469
Right over here. This is also something I would, uh, I would prefer to sort of change, so try to move… try to keep everything roughly the same.

01:33:55.191 --> 01:34:01.191
In terms of the, you know, the size of the faces and the topology and all that, you could probably do just, like, some edge creasing.

01:34:01.354 --> 01:34:06.354
Sorry, just some edge sliding, where you just double-tap G, uh, white is… sorry, symmetry's turned on.

01:34:11.676 --> 01:34:14.676
Where you just double-tap G and kind of just move them… around a little bit, that might sort of fix it, but then…

01:34:13.628 --> 01:34:19.628
Over here at the end, you've got a few… you've got quite a few of these edge loops, which you probably don't need.

01:34:20.335 --> 01:34:27.335
Right, so I will just remove the extra edge loops that you have around this area, because it might just lead to, um, just extra complexity when animating.

01:34:34.053 --> 01:34:38.053
But, again, that's… that's also… that's also reasonably minor. Um, aside from that, what are… what other…

01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:40.850
What other notes did I have? Wait, let's just have a look at the animations.

01:34:47.190 --> 01:34:50.190
Um… where is the… Rig… Change this to a dope sheet Action Editor.

01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.380
Okay, sorry, let me just…

01:35:05.829 --> 01:35:06.829
Got a timeline… Okay, so… wait, let me just…

01:35:08.655 --> 01:35:11.655
Yep, so this was an idle animation, I believe. Uh, like the animation, really cute.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
So, you know, small, cute movements, that's really good. Let's just have a look at the others.

01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:25.109
Okay, that's nothing… And then pupils actions, I'm assuming that's nothing. So I'm… at least for now, I'm guessing that this is the…

01:35:26.663 --> 01:35:36.663
That this is the only animation. But, um, with this animation, yeah, really cute. Now, something I've noticed in the animation is if you have a look at this, um… this bit over here, you see how much that's sort of moving around?

01:35:37.393 --> 01:35:45.393
Again, that's more of a weight issue, so it's… this is what I kind of mentioned about the… the sort of porcupine quills and this sort of stuff. You sometimes need to be a bit more careful with the weights.

01:35:44.746 --> 01:35:48.746
Because I'm sure that if we look at the weights right now.

01:35:54.053 --> 01:35:58.053
The weights for this object are going to be very different from some of these other ones, so… Let's just see… yeah, so for example, that is completely controlled by the pelvis.

01:36:00.059 --> 01:36:02.059
Right? And… but then… You have this one over here.

01:36:05.161 --> 01:36:08.161
Which is fully controlled by… by what? What is that controlled by?

01:36:13.904 --> 01:36:19.904
Okay, that's fully controlled by the spine bone. And so, you notice how that's, uh, like, it just leads to some, uh, to slightly… Um, strange animation stuff, where…

01:36:19.161 --> 01:36:25.161
You've got these two, sort of, quills, and they're located… or, like, groups of quills, and they're basically in the same spot.

01:36:30.635 --> 01:36:35.635
But one of them is controlled completely by one bone, and the other one's controlled completely by… by another. And so then, when you look at the animations, that's why they kind of move around relative to each other so much.

01:36:36.143 --> 01:36:42.143
Right, so that's just something you might want to have a look at. You might want to do a sort of blend of influence in terms of bones.

01:36:47.659 --> 01:36:49.659
So, for example, with this one… So, with that one, that one is controlled.

01:36:56.793 --> 01:36:59.793
Fully by bone pelvis. Maybe what we can do is we can… Uh… Hold on, where are the… where are the controls for the, um, for the assignments?

01:37:03.578 --> 01:37:08.578
Uh, let's just go to Edit Mode. So maybe this can be assigned a weight of… I don't know. Maybe, like, 0.6 or something?

01:37:09.034 --> 01:37:12.034
Let's just go 0.6, let's just see if this works. Assign.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Right? And then, if you select… what is it, bone spine… Maybe assign a value of 0.4?

01:37:31.633 --> 01:37:34.633
Assign. And now they'll… be sort of less… like, less of that range of movement than you had before. Like, it's a little bit less, so maybe you'd want to do more of a…

01:37:43.124 --> 01:37:45.124
More of a difference, like, for example, Gore… I don't know, point for, uh… you know, 0.5 here, and then also 0.5 on the pelvis, right? Just play around with it.

01:37:45.093 --> 01:37:49.093
But, um, yeah, that's just something that I would do to maybe, like, fix.

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:55.860
Those things kind of moving completely out of sync. But yeah, other than that, did the team want to share something, or…?

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.680
Um, good morning, sir? Hi.

01:38:05.731 --> 01:38:07.731
Nice to meet you.

01:38:06.532 --> 01:38:10.532
Thank you for inviting me. And the tips is very helpful. I don't actually have a question, because it's already answered by your review, and…

01:38:09.811 --> 01:38:13.811
Maybe I'll just gonna share my screen to show you the texture.

01:38:18.178 --> 01:38:20.178
Sure, that's good. What was your question that was already answered?

01:38:24.355 --> 01:38:28.355
Like, the movement.

01:38:30.066 --> 01:38:33.066
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so it's just that, so if you have a look at the… Um, yeah, with these, it's a little bit tricky. It's just, um… wait, let's just…

01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:44.031
Let's just select everything. So… When you have situations like this, where this is going to be completely influenced by one bone, but then…

01:38:43.092 --> 01:38:46.092
Um, these are going to be completely influenced by another bone.

01:38:52.388 --> 01:39:03.388
You just want to make sure they're at least far enough away from each other that it looks natural. So that's why over here it looks very, um… why over here it's very noticeable, because these are basically both kind of growing from the… basically the same place, right? So if they were sort of further apart from each other, then I think that wouldn't be as noticeable.

01:39:11.408 --> 01:39:14.408
That's a real… I realized I'm not sharing my screen anymore, but, um, yeah.

01:39:23.129 --> 01:39:25.129
Wait…

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.360
But she's preparing herself.

01:39:34.956 --> 01:39:36.956
All good.

01:39:44.626 --> 01:39:47.626
Thank you, I appreciate that. So, if, uh, the character in the environment also, we meet the environment directly and utility, so…

01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:53.610
Nice, I really like the style of the environment, the, uh, like, you've got that sort of, like, dreamy kind of, like, bloom look, which is, uh, which is really cool.

01:39:50.322 --> 01:39:52.322
It's like…

01:39:59.428 --> 01:40:03.428
Yeah, because their heads… their team… team is Magical Forest, so that's why there is…

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:09.730
Yeah, and you immediately get that sort of, like, magical kind of forest vibe, so that's really cool.

01:40:06.766 --> 01:40:08.766
A lot of… something like that.

01:40:10.610 --> 01:40:15.610
I like the, um… you've also… I can see you've got, like, a Fresnel effect on the, um, on the hedgehog at the top, so that, like, sort of outline.

01:40:15.562 --> 01:40:19.562
That shima, that's really cool, I think that really adds to the, uh, kind of magical effect.

01:40:24.631 --> 01:40:26.631
It's really cool. Yeah, I like the, um, uh, yeah, from what I can see from here.

01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:31.060
I think, yeah, really good, um, really good idea with the textures. It's simple.

01:40:30.672 --> 01:40:37.672
Um, and that's exactly what you want here. You don't want, um, overly complicated or detailed textures. I think this is really good.

01:40:37.494 --> 01:40:44.494
Yeah, uh, like, consistency is, um, is really important, and I think, like, this character looks like it really fits in that environment.

01:40:48.553 --> 01:40:50.553
Which… which that's perfect.

01:40:51.232 --> 01:40:57.232
I don't know English, actually.

01:40:57.528 --> 01:40:59.528
Sure.

01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:05.229
And there's, like, sneaky brown. And then…

01:41:06.793 --> 01:41:08.793
Nice. So, something, um, also something I'll mention in terms of the idle animation, again, this is a very minor point.

01:41:09.456 --> 01:41:16.456
But, if I'm, for example, looking at the sidele animation, what I think… what I see is this hedgehog is nodding, like, it's agreeing with something.

01:41:22.868 --> 01:41:28.868
Right, kind of like saying yes. So that's not a problem in itself, it's just, um… it's just that… it might sort of… something like that may communicate to the player that this is an animation for actually agreeing or, like, saying yes to something.

01:41:34.208 --> 01:41:36.208
Very, very small thing.

01:41:39.619 --> 01:41:41.619
Mm-hmm.

01:41:45.193 --> 01:41:50.193
So with this, um, okay, with the walk animation, I'd say with the walk animation, it doesn't look like.

01:41:52.305 --> 01:41:56.305
It's walking, it looks like it's just kind of standing in place, but kind of… you know, um, doing movements with his feet.

01:41:56.903 --> 01:42:05.903
So, with the walk animation, um, you probably want… you want some more actual sliding, right? So you want the foot to kind of go down and slide back, and then go up.

01:42:05.928 --> 01:42:09.928
Go down and slide back, go up, go forward, go down, slide back, and so forth.

01:42:17.328 --> 01:42:20.328
Now, for this character, because the feet are so small. I don't think it's gonna make a colossal difference, so, you know, for this, I think this actually could… this may very well be fine.

01:42:20.317 --> 01:42:23.317
Especially if you're mainly looking at this character, like, from the top.

01:42:23.071 --> 01:42:30.071
Um, but just something to keep in mind, where you probably want that sliding back. Otherwise, right now, it looks like it's just standing in place.

01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:36.281
But the animation itself is very cute.

01:42:38.246 --> 01:42:43.246
I haven't, uh, put it. I'm here, so, yeah.

01:42:45.471 --> 01:42:53.471
Yeah, with the spines, I think, yeah, going with a morph target, sorry, with a shape key, yeah, it's good. I would just add a bit more movement, because right now it's very, very… Um, it's very barely noticeable.

01:42:54.791 --> 01:42:59.791
Well, actually, there's a reason to it, because our character is, like, an explorer.

01:43:04.118 --> 01:43:06.118
True.

01:43:11.826 --> 01:43:13.826
Okay, that's hot. It's mentally fairly scaffold animals, so in our chiropractic, it's more like a brave character. Therefore, that is why.

01:43:16.312 --> 01:43:19.312
He doesn't be like, um… move, uh, a lot.

01:43:18.072 --> 01:43:20.072
Okay.

01:43:19.711 --> 01:43:25.711
Okay, no, no, sure, that makes sense. Like, if it's just, like, you know, it's more, like, showing that it's, like, slightly worried or something.

01:43:29.348 --> 01:43:32.348
Um, as opposed to aggressive, yeah, I think that's, uh… That could be fine. Just as long as it's, like, visible when it's happening.

01:43:36.867 --> 01:43:38.867
Thank you very much, Lance.

01:43:40.363 --> 01:43:42.363
Oh, thank you. Really cute. Alright, so in that case, I think we've got, um, I think we've got one more project.

01:43:43.233 --> 01:43:48.233
To go. It's the, uh, the Zeus Chicken? The chicken of Zeus.

01:43:45.758 --> 01:43:47.758
Yep. Good.

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:54.780
Yep, the, uh…

01:43:55.150 --> 01:43:59.150
Actually send you, uh, the dispositions. Of the sea's chickens.

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.360
Sorry, what, you want to send an update?

01:44:05.799 --> 01:44:08.799
Yeah, I actually sent you an update. On your personal organization, private music.

01:44:08.111 --> 01:44:12.111
Oh, uh, let me… give me a second, let me just check quickly.

01:44:13.139 --> 01:44:18.139
Sorry, um, personal, you mean, um, what, you mean to the email, or here in the chat?

01:44:21.023 --> 01:44:25.023
Um, the private Zoom chat.

01:44:22.178 --> 01:44:26.178
Oh, a private Zoom chat. Okay, sorry, actually, hold on, I don't use Zoom that often. I need to have a look.

01:44:29.266 --> 01:44:32.266
I think if you open the chat, there is, uh… new people.

01:44:35.274 --> 01:44:37.274
Kind of similar to what… with the… These are 10 to them.

01:44:43.712 --> 01:44:45.712
Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep. Okay. Sorry, yeah, yeah, I see that now. Give me one second…

01:44:45.192 --> 01:44:47.192
Elisa.

01:44:52.037 --> 01:44:54.037
Yep. Just one second, um, so this is the updated, um, version of the… sorry, let me just… let me just download them while…

01:44:57.664 --> 01:44:59.664
While I'm… Waiting? Okay, Zeus chicken…

01:45:01.767 --> 01:45:04.767
Sorry, I'll just chuck that into a folder.

01:45:04.176 --> 01:45:06.176
Well, more dying chickens, uh… The wings, it pulls something.

01:45:09.919 --> 01:45:12.919
Uh, they will awkwardly…

01:45:10.085 --> 01:45:13.085
Uh, with the, uh, they pulled, uh, like, uh, moving with the Bones, you mean?

01:45:17.979 --> 01:45:22.979
Um, wait, let me just see, we've changed the idle movement works on the walk and feed cycles… loop smoother, and figure out how to make the walk jump… working on the texture.

01:45:30.337 --> 01:45:32.337
Make it feel more stylized without looking tacky.

01:45:35.682 --> 01:45:39.682
Okay, um, let me just open it, and then I'll… and then I'll, um… I'll go through your questions.

01:45:46.599 --> 01:45:48.599
Okay, so there are… Let me see, so we've got two… two files. You've got character and environment.

01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:52.926
Um, character and environment final? Is that the one I should look at?

01:46:01.704 --> 01:46:03.704
Um, the one with… character animation is actually, and she can sister…

01:46:03.678 --> 01:46:06.678
Any meeting there? But the environment?

01:46:10.987 --> 01:46:15.987
Uh, no, the animation actually on the… she can's sister file.

01:46:12.046 --> 01:46:14.046
Wait, sorry, so not this one, the other one?

01:46:20.238 --> 01:46:22.238
So…

01:46:20.672 --> 01:46:23.672
Oh, right, yep. Yep, gotcha.

01:46:41.506 --> 01:46:45.506
Um, actually, while that's loading, um, wait, let me just have a look at the… At the actual environment. Okay, so there's a world texture, but it's not loaded, so wait, let me just remove that.

01:46:50.386 --> 01:46:52.386
Um… Yeah, that HDR file, I don't think that's… That's there.

01:46:56.549 --> 01:46:59.549
Sorry. Uh…

01:46:59.299 --> 01:47:03.299
Okay, so you've got a son… yeah, sorry, it's just the texture's not showing up.

01:47:02.799 --> 01:47:10.799
So, you had a question about the environment. You said, aiming for something more ethereal and Olympus-like, giving it more of a fairytale quality instead of just a Greek-style pavilion.

01:47:10.389 --> 01:47:20.389
Best way to make the day and night ambiences feel relatively contrasting. So, look, um, if we're going, like, really simple, kind of, like, cheap ways to make them feel contrasting, and you want more of an ethereal look.

01:47:20.499 --> 01:47:26.499
So, um, I know you had a HDRI here somewhere, it's just that it didn't come with the scene, which had, like, a starry night.

01:47:26.636 --> 01:47:31.636
Um, that's good. The sun itself, or, like, the light, yes, have that a little bit more blue.

01:47:32.134 --> 01:47:38.134
So, right now, that's red, so that's not gonna do exactly what you want. So having, like, a colder light.

01:47:38.334 --> 01:47:44.334
That's one thing. Something else that, um, I would maybe do is, if you have, you know, this is like a Greek pavilion.

01:47:44.885 --> 01:47:52.885
Right? And you think… like, if I'm thinking, you know, like, kind of Mount Olympus, like, at night, Greek pavilion, I'm imagining, like, you know, fires on top… on tops of columns.

01:47:53.128 --> 01:47:58.128
Right? So that's something that I would add. Maybe at least, like, some lights that, um, that sort of imitate fire.

01:47:58.070 --> 01:48:03.070
Um, you know, somewhere… somewhere around the scene, I think that would do it.

01:48:02.765 --> 01:48:07.765
Another thing that you can do is just add some fog, right? Like, sort of like, you know, some mist at night.

01:48:10.168 --> 01:48:21.168
Um, you know, to get that kind of more ethereal look. Now, in terms of mist, the way that you… okay, um, also, you're gonna have to excuse me, I haven't done this in actual years, so I might… Completely screw up in terms of how to do this.

01:48:27.089 --> 01:48:31.089
But, I believe you need to create a… Wait, what are we in? Um…

01:48:35.728 --> 01:48:41.728
So, you need to create a shape, and then the material needs to be a… Uh, what is it? It needs to be a volume scatter material, I believe.

01:48:47.178 --> 01:48:52.178
Like, I never do… I never actually do any rendering inside Blender, so this is, like, my, um… my… uh… my worst, sort of, skill.

01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:58.010
Okay, yeah, you do that, and then… That, yeah, that's basically it. Okay.

01:48:57.642 --> 01:49:00.642
So, yeah, if you want to add some fog, this is a cheap way to add fog.

01:49:01.073 --> 01:49:04.073
Right? So, again, I'll just go through that sort of process again.

01:49:07.067 --> 01:49:10.067
You add a shape, right? I'll just add a cube for now, over here.

01:49:14.986 --> 01:49:17.986
Right? Um, create a new material? And then with the material, you change it from a principled BSDF to a volume scatter.

01:49:17.929 --> 01:49:23.929
Right? Now, a weird thing here is that you actually, by default, this material is set up wrong.

01:49:28.067 --> 01:49:30.067
Right? So you need to change it from… Uh, you need to change the output from surface to volume.

01:49:32.622 --> 01:49:35.622
Right? And that basically gives you… fog, right? You just… you adjust the density.

01:49:35.557 --> 01:49:40.557
But, um, yeah, that's basically how you do it. So if you want to add, like, again.

01:49:46.337 --> 01:49:49.337
Something reasonably simple. But which adds that sort of, you know, dreamlike…

01:49:50.073 --> 01:49:52.073
Effect, then I would just… I would just do something like this.

01:49:54.284 --> 01:49:59.284
Right? Again, you probably want to play around with the lighting and environment and all of that, but… Yeah, that's, uh, that's one thing that I would do.

01:50:04.478 --> 01:50:12.478
Other than that, with this environment, what I saw, I actually really like the design of, like, all of the props. Like, I think the clouds that you've done and… the stars, the moon, like, the sort of the low-poly tree. I think these are all actually really, really cool.

01:50:15.966 --> 01:50:22.966
So, um, you know, very consistent style, and I think that's absolutely great. I probably wouldn't have the world be… have hard edges, so I would shade that smooth.

01:50:28.228 --> 01:50:34.228
Right? But I probably also wouldn't have it be kind of reflective or shiny, so I would have the… I would lower the… I would… I would up the roughness, because… Um, yeah, with low roughness, it just looks a little bit strange.

01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:39.629
But yeah, the environment itself looks really good. Let me move on to the chicken.

01:50:47.915 --> 01:50:51.915
Um, okay, so chicken… Okay, so I'm assuming… hold on, I don't think the text just came through…

01:50:55.606 --> 01:50:57.606
On this one… So, shader editor…

01:51:03.087 --> 01:51:05.087
Yeah, I don't think they came through. But, let me just talk about the overall design.

01:51:11.761 --> 01:51:14.761
Yeah, I think the texture didn't come true.

01:51:15.324 --> 01:51:18.324
Yeah, no, no, no, it's all good. Like, I think, uh, yeah… We can have a look at the geometry first.

01:51:19.182 --> 01:51:23.182
So, geometry, overall, the, like, the structure of the geometry is fine.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:29.000
But it is very, very subdivided, so there's, um, there's probably a lot more geometry here than you actually need.

01:51:31.992 --> 01:51:33.992
So right now, it's… Um… let's go statistics.

01:51:37.741 --> 01:51:39.741
Yeah, so right now you've got, um… Yeah, so, like, 12,000 faces on this. I'd say that's way too much.

01:51:39.496 --> 01:51:44.496
For something like this, you can subdivide it by quite a lot, and it would still sort of keep its overall shape.

01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:49.510
So just to sort of demonstrate that, if we take… just this mesh.

01:51:54.903 --> 01:51:56.903
Right? Which, that now looks horrifying. But if we just go…

01:51:58.685 --> 01:52:01.685
Let's remove that. If we go decimate… Uh, where's that? Generate, decimate.

01:52:03.766 --> 01:52:08.766
So decimate is the opposite of subdivision… subdivision surface, so it basically… takes your mesh and makes it less complicated.

01:52:10.574 --> 01:52:15.574
But it is, um… it can sometimes break things, so I wouldn't recommend… So you'd need to kind of use it more carefully.

01:52:20.824 --> 01:52:22.824
But right now, we've got 12,000… Um, 12,000… 6,000 faces.

01:52:26.259 --> 01:52:31.259
Right? Um, and if we just look at the actual geometry itself, we don't look at the textures.

01:52:36.190 --> 01:52:38.190
Right? This is what we had initially. Right? Um…

01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:46.410
You know, I wouldn't subdivide it this much. But… subdividing it this much, like, this is completely fine, and this is already, like, one quarter.

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:49.459
This is one quarter of the amount of faces you had before.

01:52:50.086 --> 01:52:54.086
Right, so it's just to say that I would make it a little bit.

01:52:57.853 --> 01:52:59.853
A little bit simpler. Um, just in terms of the subdivisions.

01:53:05.571 --> 01:53:12.571
Another thing I noticed, uh, with the feet, like, same sort of thing over here. I understand that you were sub-D modeling, but… I think with this one… this is my personal preference. I probably wouldn't put in, like, these parts.

01:53:18.991 --> 01:53:20.991
Over here, like, these sort of claws. Um, just because they're really small and they… you know, you've got this really kind of big, fat chicken.

01:53:26.293 --> 01:53:32.293
And you've got really big, sort of, details on everything. You've got, like, you know, these wings… Um, the tail, um, you know, every… everything is kind of really enlarged, but then you've got these really tiny.

01:53:39.419 --> 01:53:46.419
Claws on the bottom. So it just, like, to me, that looks a little bit strange. I would probably remove those sooner, just have it sort of end… Um… kind of there, but, like, keeping it sharp, if that sort of makes sense. But again, that's my personal preference.

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:54.440
And I would cut it down, because right now you've got a lot of… Um, you've got a lot of geometry here, which is…

01:53:58.529 --> 01:54:00.529
Probably not as necessary. Um, other than that, let's just have a look at the…

01:54:04.412 --> 01:54:08.412
Uh, let's just have a look at the animations. And the deformation, so… Just gonna go Dirt Sheet…

01:54:07.947 --> 01:54:10.947
Okay, so we've got that, and then what's this? That's a timeline.

01:54:20.946 --> 01:54:28.946
Um, feed animation is really cool. I would add a little bit of movement to the wings. Right now, they're just, like, they're kind of robotic, where they just move into position, and then they move back.

01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:33.870
So, you know, having them maybe, like, flap a little bit while it's moving will make it feel a tiny bit less robotic.

01:54:39.347 --> 01:54:42.347
But, um, the movement, sort of, of the head. Um, and the tail, it's really good. So, you know, it's very, very clear, like, what…

01:54:47.122 --> 01:54:50.122
What the chicken is actually doing, right? Um… Let's have a look… let's keep going. Foot action, what's foot action, foot action. It's an empty one.

01:54:54.669 --> 01:54:56.669
Walk.

01:54:56.719 --> 01:55:10.719
Okay, so with this, um, uh, you have the same… you have the same sort of thing happening with the walk animation as the previous team with the hedgehog, where it doesn't necessarily look like it's actually walking, it looks like it's just lifting its feet and putting them down.

01:55:18.131 --> 01:55:21.131
Right? And, um, again, sort of the reason for that is… what you want is, you want the foot to actually slide back, right? So, if you take…

01:55:24.832 --> 01:55:27.832
Actual movement, right? You know, the foot… Okay, let me just grab that. So the foot kind of, you know, moves forward, and then it slides back and moves forward.

01:55:36.482 --> 01:55:38.482
And kind of does this motion. Right? So, what you've got right now, where it just kind of lifts up and kind of rotates, it doesn't necessarily look like walking, it just looks like it's lifting its leg up and putting it down again.

01:55:44.552 --> 01:55:45.552
Right, so, you know, um… I'm just… sorry, I'm gonna break your animations for a second, but…

01:55:49.892 --> 01:55:51.892
Uh, let's just go… So I'm gonna… I'm gonna do this very, very roughly.

01:55:57.309 --> 01:55:58.309
But from here…

01:55:57.598 --> 01:56:03.598
Oh, sorry, I need to do this in a different one. Alright, well, but yeah, basically what I showed, where you basically have it.

01:56:03.907 --> 01:56:10.907
Go up, then down, then slide back, and then do this sort of a loop like that. So this is more kind of how.

01:56:12.803 --> 01:56:17.803
The walk animation should go, right? And then at the end, you probably want it to… kind of get on its, sort of, toes.

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:25.508
But… not without that one. But yeah, that's basically it. Um, let me just have a look at any other animations here.

01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:33.220
Um, idle. Let's have a look at the idle animation.

01:56:41.208 --> 01:56:44.208
Um, oh, wait. There we go, let's just see. So, idle animation… okay, sort of just looking around…

01:56:43.156 --> 01:56:50.156
Yep. Yeah, that's fine. Like, you probably want it to be a little bit longer, otherwise you're gonna have an issue where it just looks like it's constantly saying no.

01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:55.060
On a loop, but, um… Yeah, other than that, looks really good.

01:56:55.773 --> 01:57:00.773
Um, with, uh, with idle animations, generally what I found is more useful is.

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:06.800
You have, like, um… again, this is usually for more complex characters, but you'd have a few, sort of.

01:57:07.554 --> 01:57:11.554
Long idle animations, right? Sort of just, like, standing around, kind of not doing much.

01:57:11.466 --> 01:57:19.466
But then you have some shorter idle animations, like, you know, like, hey, I'm gonna, like, scratch my head, or I'm gonna, like, look at my watch, or I'm going to, you know, kind of just, like.

01:57:19.654 --> 01:57:29.654
Stretch, or something, right? And you have an idle animation play, and it can be one of the long ones, and then you randomly choose one of the shorter idle animations. That gets played through.

01:57:30.159 --> 01:57:35.159
And then another random longer animation gets played through. So, you know, um, you can also kind of merge these up.

01:57:37.825 --> 01:57:48.825
It's not necessarily that you have to do it with this, I'm just saying that as general tips. Oh, uh, last thing as well, um, everything is, um, everything is… has hot edges, so you probably want that to be… Uh, smoothed.

01:57:56.017 --> 01:57:58.017
Smoothed out. And with this one. Hold on. Should it smooth? Yeah, you probably want to get rid of the hard edges, because I don't think they make too much sense here.

01:58:00.588 --> 01:58:04.588
Uh, well, you might want to keep the hot edges sort of just around… like, these loops over here.

01:58:05.105 --> 01:58:07.105
Right? These are probably the only ones that you want to keep.

01:58:10.169 --> 01:58:12.169
Yeah. Um… Yeah, so that's just gonna be visible over here.

01:58:14.091 --> 01:58:19.091
Okay. Alright, um, but yeah, did the team, uh, have any questions?

01:58:23.514 --> 01:58:25.514
Well, I want to discuss something? Mm-hmm.

01:58:26.649 --> 01:58:28.649
That is the one question. Are doing the waves, uh… They kind of hold.

01:58:31.210 --> 01:58:33.210
Like, awkwardly. I don't know.

01:58:34.731 --> 01:58:37.731
The wings, you mean?

01:58:37.725 --> 01:58:40.725
Yeah, it looks so…

01:58:39.451 --> 01:58:45.451
So, let me just see. Uh, let me… wait, let's just see. So, if we go clear… transform all.

01:58:51.141 --> 01:58:52.141
Let me just have a look. Sir…

01:58:56.623 --> 01:58:58.623
So if we go have a look at the wings…

01:59:02.210 --> 01:59:04.210
Okay, hold on, you've got a lot of weights.

01:59:05.123 --> 01:59:10.123
Okay, um, my suggestion? Remove 90% of the bones in the wings.

01:59:15.832 --> 01:59:18.832
Like, honestly, you probably don't need this many bones. That would be… that would be probably the main thing, because if you…

01:59:18.065 --> 01:59:20.065
Yeah, let me just have a look at the skeleton again.

01:59:22.008 --> 01:59:27.008
Wait, uh… oh, wait, wait, wait, you have done that, hold on, sorry.

01:59:26.664 --> 01:59:28.664
Actually, my…

01:59:26.962 --> 01:59:33.962
So we've got Wing L, wing 2L, wing 3, Wing 4L… wait, let me just have a look at those specific weights.

01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:43.540
Um… when… Wait, okay, hold on, first thing is… first thing is…

01:59:43.059 --> 01:59:49.059
You need to get rid of all of these wing feather weights, because even though you don't have bones affecting them.

01:59:51.223 --> 01:59:55.223
They are still being affected by something theoretical called. Wfeather underscore 004.

01:59:56.644 --> 01:59:59.644
So, that's the first thing, right? So… Let's just remove all of those.

02:00:04.479 --> 02:00:11.479
Right? And you see right now, so that's… that's basically the issue, is that you remove the bones, but the weights aren't adjusted, so… Um.

02:00:18.764 --> 02:00:22.764
That may already kind of bend better. Right? Than it did before. Actually, let's…

02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:26.617
Hold on. Let me… bring those back.

02:00:31.347 --> 02:00:34.347
And then let's just have a look now. So, if we start bending this…

02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:43.930
Okay, so let's just have a look at this last one. So if I start moving this around, you see this part over here bends as well?

02:00:44.165 --> 02:00:48.165
Now, let's just check. If we, again, remove all of those.

02:00:54.964 --> 02:00:56.964
Further… If we remove all of those feathers, and I think we had…

02:01:01.437 --> 02:01:03.437
Okay, that's all of the feather bones, right? There's some more over here…

02:01:03.085 --> 02:01:06.085
Oh, yep, and we've got these bones over here, let's just remove those.

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:14.520
Okay, let's just check, see if that affects anything. Okay, um, I think…

02:01:17.882 --> 02:01:19.882
I think that might be better, I'm not 100% sure. It's a bit difficult to say, but, like.

02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:28.149
At this point, this is probably… Yeah, this is probably what you… what you'd roughly want in terms of this geometry.

02:01:36.952 --> 02:01:39.952
Right? Yeah, just have this, don't have any of those specific, um… specific feathers, but then just the way that it folds… so, yeah, let's just have a look at your…

02:01:44.507 --> 02:01:46.507
Um. Wait, let's just have a look at your…

02:01:50.546 --> 02:01:52.546
Other animations… I must have broken them because I, uh…

02:01:51.876 --> 02:01:55.876
Wait, how did I break them, though, if I didn't remove those bones? Why isn't this returning?

02:02:01.330 --> 02:02:04.330
Okay, so this is… the way that it's folding here… Um, firstly, the way that it's folding…

02:02:06.105 --> 02:02:09.105
It's folding the wrong way, right? So, sorry, let me just… move that outwards.

02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:16.380
All right. So, this bone over here… you probably want it.

02:02:18.698 --> 02:02:20.698
Um, sorry. So, firstly, probably wouldn't fold that much.

02:02:23.087 --> 02:02:25.087
But then secondly, you wanted to fold… In this sort of direction.

02:02:32.858 --> 02:02:34.858
Right? Um… And then, if we kind of move that back into position…

02:02:37.746 --> 02:02:39.746
Sorry, I know this is, like, rough positioning.

02:02:41.992 --> 02:02:44.992
Okay, now I get what you mean, it's still a little bit… it's still a little bit awkward.

02:02:45.455 --> 02:02:52.455
Um… I'm just thinking, will I have a… will I have a good answer for you without looking at how a wing folds?

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:02.180
Wing folding. I think the best… the best guess here is just actually to look at your, um… wait, bird wing folding, is just to look at references and just seeing if you can copy that.

02:03:13.294 --> 02:03:14.294
Okay, that's not useful. Let's just see.

02:03:19.369 --> 02:03:24.369
So, I think one of the reasons that it looks a little bit awkward is that everything is kind of separated.

02:03:27.514 --> 02:03:29.514
So you've got these, like, separate, sort of. Uh, parts of the feathers.

02:03:33.556 --> 02:03:35.556
And I don't think there's a way that you can kind of… make them fold really naturally.

02:03:42.689 --> 02:03:45.689
In that context, at least, like, I'm not seeing… good way. At least, like, what I mean is, like, folding them this much.

02:03:49.833 --> 02:03:51.833
If that sort of makes sense.

02:03:57.304 --> 02:03:59.304
But… Yeah, you also might need to… you do need to play around with the weights a little bit.

02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:07.040
Um… yeah, sorry, with this one, I don't really have… I don't really have a really good tip for you, uh, with this one, so sorry about that.

02:04:06.392 --> 02:04:14.392
Um, I think, like, if I was gonna do this, I would have a look at, like, actual references of how bird wings actually fold. I would also have a look at, like, more cartoons.

02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:20.720
And, like, animated… animated stuff to have a look at, like, how it's already been done with, like, animated birds, and just try to copy that.

02:04:21.232 --> 02:04:24.232
It's just like, I haven't really modeled, um, bird… bird wings.

02:04:28.956 --> 02:04:33.956
Um, I've probably done it at some point, but I don't remember, and, um, I don't remember ever animating it, so… with this, sorry, can't give any particularly useful feedback.

02:04:39.646 --> 02:04:41.646
That's really a helpful note. Great. Thank you.

02:04:42.407 --> 02:04:44.407
Okay, thanks. No, thank you. No, thank you guys.

02:04:47.248 --> 02:04:49.248
Alright, so I guess that's… that's everyone. I believe. Yep.

02:04:47.525 --> 02:04:57.525
Uh, maybe one last thing. I think all you said earlier, how to create the FOC in Blender, but do you think it's better in Blender or in Unity? Because they will be using Unity.

02:05:02.542 --> 02:05:03.542
Yeah.

02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:04.550
So, sorry, create, create what?

02:05:06.469 --> 02:05:12.469
Oh, the missed… oh, no, no, no, yeah, yes, yeah, sorry, with the mist, no, um, with the mist, you would create an Unity, definitely not in Blender.

02:05:07.245 --> 02:05:11.245
The… the… Miss, missed, Mr.

02:05:19.262 --> 02:05:27.262
Um, uh, yeah, that was more I meant, like, if you want to do it in Blender specifically, then that's the way that you would do it in Blender. No, in Unity, you would… Um, well, I'll be honest, because I don't use Unity that often, I don't remember how to create fog at all.

02:05:27.747 --> 02:05:32.747
In Unity. But yes, you would do it there. Just taking it from here, from Blender into Unity, I don't think that's going to do anything.

02:05:35.552 --> 02:05:40.552
Okay, so… so I just assume anything post-processing is… It would be better in-game engine, right?

02:05:38.168 --> 02:05:40.168
Yeah.

02:05:40.468 --> 02:05:46.468
Um, better from… like, what do you mean by better? You mean, like, more performant, or…?

02:05:44.924 --> 02:05:49.924
But the processing, like, for me, is for… or something, something like that.

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:54.709
Is it a bit in the blender, or the… in the game engine?

02:06:00.346 --> 02:06:02.346
Uh… It just depends. So, the thing is that, um, it's just what it's used for. So you would only do it in Blender if your final result is going to be in Blender.

02:06:02.424 --> 02:06:08.424
So, if, for example, you're making a movie in Blender, you want to, like, let's say, make some renders inside Blender, you would do it.

02:06:09.251 --> 02:06:15.251
But if you're taking this into Unity, if you're taking it into a game engine, you don't do any push processing in Blender, it doesn't make… like, there's no point.

02:06:20.267 --> 02:06:22.267
Because those are just completely different systems. The thing that you would take from Blender into Unity is just your 3D models, basically.

02:06:27.238 --> 02:06:29.238
Yep.

02:06:31.646 --> 02:06:36.646
Yeah, your 3D models and your animation, and your animation files, but then everything, the way that that gets… treated and, you know, like, all your shaders are created inside Unity, um, your animations would be played inside Unity.

02:06:36.867 --> 02:06:40.867
Using their system. Push-processing effects would be done inside Unity, so, yeah.

02:06:47.197 --> 02:06:49.197
Mm-hmm.

02:06:48.385 --> 02:06:50.385
Okay, good. Yep. I think that's it for today. Thank you so much, Kleb, for your feedback and insight for them. I hope.

02:06:55.924 --> 02:06:57.924
Uh, they will use all of… that information to continue their projects, and can we have a big applause for Glenn?

02:07:02.746 --> 02:07:08.746
Thank you, guys. It was really great looking at, um, looking at your projects, and again, I just want to highlight, like, really impressive, like, what the… what the teams have been able to do in a very short while.

02:07:14.584 --> 02:07:19.584
Because this is… these are very complicated topics, um, they… it takes… it does take a lot of time to… kind of get used to them, sir. Um, the fact that everyone was able to make such great projects in this time is really, really impressive.

02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:25.790
And a credit to the team.

02:07:24.729 --> 02:07:26.729
Yep, thank you so much. I think that's it for today. Thank you!

02:07:29.587 --> 02:07:31.587
Awesome. Thank you, guys. Thanks, bye.
